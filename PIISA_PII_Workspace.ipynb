He is author of over 30 publications, including The Great Crossover, The 21st Century Agent, Creative Destruction, and How The Best Get Better. Jason: Welcome to the Speaking of Wealth show Episode#4. This is your host Jason Hartman where we discuss profit strategies for speakers, publishers, and consultants. I hope you enjoyed the last few episodes. Last one we talked to Dan Poynter, the self publishing guru, and you know what he talks about is really a large part of a democratic society I think because self publishing really allows everybody to get the word out about their topic, or their area of expertise. It”s no longer a situation where this is decided by just a few big network media outlets or a few big publishers. Everybody can self publish nowadays and get the word out, and build their own following their own tribe as Seth Gordon says. Their own audience. So I hope you enjoyed that one, and then I hope you enjoyed Episode #2 Ann Bruce where we talked about how to speak for a living and then number one was with Harvey Mackay you know him of course the bestselling author multiple times over. Mr. Swim with the Sharks, Harvey Mackay and today I would like to bring over an episode from one of my other shows and that is the Creating Wealth show which I have been doing for about five years. We”ve got well over 180 episodes now, and this one I thought would be particularly interesting to speakers, publishers, consultants, coaches, and so forth because this one is with Dan Sullivan, the strategic coach. And he talks about business, and how to grow your business, how to expand your business. I”ve been following his content for many years since I discovered him through Young Entrepreneurs Organization kind of a sister organization to YPO Young Presidents Organization at their university several years back in New York City and Dan Sullivan is just a great guy. So we got two Dan”s in a row here. And let”s go to the interview with Dan Sullivan the strategic coach taken Creating Wealth show Episode#123. I think you will really enjoy this as a speaker, publisher and consultant. We will be back with that in just a second. Introduction: What”s great about the show is you will find on jasonhartman.com is that if you want to learn how to finance your next big real estate deal, there is a show for that. If you want to learn more about food storage, and the best way to keep those onions from smelling up everything else there is a show for that. If you honestly want to know more about business ethics, there is a show for that. And if you just want to get away from at all, and need to know something about world travel, there is even a show for that. Yeah there is a show for just about anything only from jasonhartman.com or type in Jason Hartman in the iTune store. Jason: It”s my pleasure to welcome Dan Miller to the show. He is the President of 48 days and he specializes in creative thinking and increase personal and business success, helping people discover their unique natural gifts in integrating them into career choices, new career choices, and business choices. Dan it”s great to have you on the show. Dan: Thank you Jason. I am looking forward to talking to you. Jason: Well, likewise. Tell us a little about what is it you do? Dan: I am a author and life coach, and usually the tags that I hang behind my name. I”ve had the privilege of moving into more and more writings in the last few years, but got into this kind of space by being a career coach discovered there were so many people basing inevitable and relentless job transitions and so I have to place here many years now working with people who were looking at making those changes, and these are usually people that are not having not just lost the job at Taco Bell, but often people who feel trapped by virtue of their academic training, so physicians, attorneys, dentists, pastors who really often at 45 years old wake up and say I am living somebody else”s dream. This is not my dream. Help me make a change, and so I help people make those changes, see what the opportunities are often by really taking a for instance look at the new kind of work models that we have today available and they really are exploding all around us even as we speak, so its not just a matter of where can I go and get a job, and have them guarantee me a paycheck, give me a paycheck on Friday and a 401k contribution and medical benefits that mean I would be part of what the new opportunity looks like, but I am excited about helping people in that arena. And then as a result I do a lot of writing. I have written a couple of different books that address those kind of issues and help people understand what their options are. Jason: Well fantastic, so Dan what are some of the new opportunities out there. We live in such an innovative world, and I marvel at it everyday at how capitalism is just such a wonderfully freeing thing for the human spirit, and how it just every possible need any of us could imagine someone is there to fill it. It”s just amazing. Jason: But with the internet and with the ability to have a home based business, a small business, and level that playing field or flattened that playing field a little bit. The little guy really has a lot of opportunities nowadays don’t they probably more than ever before. Dan: Yeah absolutely right. I love the way you frame that. Capitalism is a freeing experience, and that it is. And it is, has never been easier to become a player than what it is today. You know with the internet, and that”s not just the magic tool for everybody, but certainly it opens some doors, it kind of flattens the world so to speak where you can be a player in a real tiny, tiny niche. I mean you can have sun glasses for dogs where you could never justify opening in a retail store for that because there wouldn”t be enough people within the geographic radius, but if you are on the internet you instantly have accessed to the entire world theoretically, and you can get a really tiny, tiny portion of the prospects there, and still knock it on the park. You know I”ve done that with my own personal books where I love books. It would be real tempting for me to open a nice clean little bookstore in Franklin, Tennessee, and what its for real term where I realized I am never going to do that. There is nowhere in the world. You know where I am going to confine myself to a five mile radius of prospects? No. I had a bookstore on the internet, and because of that we get orders from literally all over the world that amazes me everyday. Its never seem too amazed, and how we had penetrated in to another countries beyond the United States. Now it is easy to start a business. Also when we use to talk about starting the business we would think about a bolly-nolly service station, hardware store, bookstore something like that, but today the most profitable business often don’t have any bricks and mortar at all. They are using service information or technology as their key concept, and so somebody can become a player right along with a major, major company you can make yourself look like a player in that same space by simply having a nicely designed website and offering service a value to people. Jason: And what are some of these innovative businesses, of course you mentioned kind of half sarcastically sun glasses for dogs, but only half sarcastically I think. What are some of the really unique things you are seeing out there because there is just a limitless number of ideas aren”t there? There is a website for everything. Dan: There really is. And again I love the web, and what its able to do, and I have seen people take very common ideas and do really well there, but also I don”t want to make that just the cookie cutter solution for everybody. There are opportunities for people who are not tech-savvy to do something with the unique skill that they have, and still do extremely well. We have on our property here in Franklin, Tennessee a tree that got damaged in the storm a couple of years ago beyond restoration. Well, been an old farm kid I hate losing a tree and I could hardly bare the thought of just cutting this thing down than having an ugly stump to deal with. So I called, made a couple of phone calls, called the place who repairs my chainsaw. I said aren”t that people that carved in wood. Well, they gave me a number I called. He gave me a another number. I talked to a lady. She said well, you know I carve in wood, but I never done a standing tree. I have only done things on my bench in my shop, but if you are open to it, I would be happy to come out and take a look with you. I said well, come on out. Well, she did, she carved two faces one on either side of that dead tree in our yard. Now these we call at our wisdom guard and we actually have created a little garden around it. Kids love to come up, and touch this faces. They are about four feet tall. It looks like we got Abraham and Moses looking to cross our yard in either directions, so we took what was going to be an ugly stump and transformed into an permanent piece of art in our property. Now, here is the thing about that lady. She had been a corporate executive, never married was making a very reasonable income, and just realized that her soul was being sucked out, or she sat at a cubicle everyday and she kind of tapped into her passion. So she said read one of my books 48 days To The Work You Love. She says helped her do that realize she was off base instead of doing this kind of work. Now, the interesting about this is you would never ever meet with your high school or college, guidance counselor, and they would say you need to grew up and be a tree carver. Dan: Well, you are not going to find that in the dictionary of occupational titles. Its way too individualized, but that”s just really in part. You can find something that is so individualized, so personalized that it engages your unique passions, dreams, and values, and do extremely well. There really isn”t much barrier to entry. That means and may it be intimidating to some people think well, gee I am not an entrepreneur. I am not a Donald Trumpeted turn to kind of person you don’t have to be. You can shape the idea around what is unique about you. And that”s really where we get the power of these ideas is in finding things that are I will ask them to accept. I”ve got a tree carver I couldn”t do that. But for this lady that tapped into some childhood passions that she had, and it was a perfect fit for her. I”ve got a gentlemen who came to me as a — actually as a pastor, and he thought he was doing something very godly, but at the same time it was very frustrating just eking out of living. He was working as a desk clerk at a hotel during the weeknights in order to just keep the lights on in his house because they were struggling so much financially. It came to me, and we”ve kind of peeled the onion so to speak which is always the case. We don’t have to just put something on top of the person and say here is the best opportunity or trend. It”s usually a matter of looking inward first. What does make you tick? What puts you in the zone? What is it that when you are doing at time just flies by? Well, with this young guy he would talk about going into a room in their house, closing the door, he would put on Beethoven and Mozart, and he would draw just as dramatic abstract paintings, had never sold anything in his life, but he would do that just kind of as a personal release and cleansing. I hadn’t quit what he was doing. Everything he was doing including pasturing the church. And for four years he did though finishes were he would use brushes, punches, rags and produces dramatic effects on the walls of peoples businesses and homes, but that gave him the freedom to do this really beautiful paintings. Today he doesn’t do full finishes at all. He simply does these paintings. I have one hanging here in my office, so they gave me just out of appreciation for the transformation he experienced and it’s a $10,000 painting which is pretty typical of his work at his point. And here is the interesting thing about that. If I wanted to just simply address his financial needs would I have suggested that we come an artist? Well, we know we hear about artist start being an artist, and we have hundreds of them in any city in America, but if that is really his authentic fit that”s his best opportunity to find work that is fulfilling meaningful purposeful and profitable. And with him at this point his income, he estimates his income is 12 to 15 times what he would ever have made as a pastor. We didn’t do it because of the money, but the money showed up because it was an authentic fit. And I think that”s what a lot of people are missing Jason where they are just trying to do something well that they don’t really believe that may think they”ve been responsible by just trying to do something to produce a paycheck that”s a horrible trade-off to make. Jason: I remember from years ago Dan, and what you are saying reminds me of it. One of my great mentors was Earl Nightingale. I am also a huge fan of Denis Waitley and Zig Ziglar of course, and all those from kind of the old school of motivational speakers and writers and so forth, but I remember one of the things Earl Nightingale taught me many years ago. He said that there were two types of people, two types of actually I should distinguish successful people. One type is the river person and the type is the goal person. And you were just making me think of that because what he says is he says the river people are those just fortunate souls who kind of always know what they wanted to do, and what their passion was. And all they had to do in life is just be in that river of interest so if its music they would be the most art of it was painting. They could be the next Michelangelo or Da Vinci or whoever, and all they had to do is be in it because they were so passionate about it, so interested and so consumed by it that it really wasn”t work for them. Then he says for most of us though, if we are not a river person or we haven’t discovered our river of interest yet, and I know you help people do that, so I definitely want to hear more about that. It”s just incumbent on us to be goal people and set goals, and achieve them progressively, but I guess at some point like you say the goal person and I can be a drag baby if its so far out of alignment with ones passion and interest in life, right? Dan: Absolutely. Those goals are to getting you closer and closer; closer to what is the true passion. If you are just trying to again make yourself do that. It”s sometimes people they had that perception of goals, that it just kind of forces you to do the right thing. Goals ought to be the very true expression of what you really want to accomplish in your life. They just help you get there quicker. Jason: Well, how can one — I mean I love the questions you just mentioned. What turns you on? What are your passion is about? What sort of moves you, but how can someone really know what their thing is because I talk to people and I try to counsel them, and helped them when they come to me with this sort of dilemma and what should I do with the rest of my life, or whether they are young, or middle age, or older? People live so long nowadays, and have so many choices that sometimes just the choices can be really daunting. How can someone really identify what”s right for them? Dan: You know people struggle with this a lot whether they are still trying to find their passion, their purpose, destiny calling how we want to frame that but just to make it easy just describe what their passion is. I don’t really understand why it”s so difficult, and I work with people. I have been doing this for 25 years, and I still don’t — its still concerns me, and makes me scratch my head to find people who don’t recognize their own passions easier. And I have a two year old granddaughter who spends a lot of time with me because her momma works for me. It”s not very difficult at all to see what her passions are. I mean you walk to a Wal-Mart store you are going to know real quick what little _____ [0:17:19] cares about. Jason: For a two year old? Jason: Now tell us about that you know. Dan: Well, she is so transparent. I mean if its teddy bears as opposed to doll babies, or if it”s something in the — if it”s been outside you know rather than being can bind inside, but she is extremely transparent. The foods she likes the same kind of foods that I do you know. She goes with me to Mexican restaurants and likes the salsa and chips, and that she doesn”t care for peas and carrots. I mean she is so transparent in things that she is really drawn to. And at adult seem to have just pulled bailed cloud down over their eyes where they just don’t even really understand what they enjoy and what they don’t. Now, I understand that you know light happened, and sometimes we can kind of come become numb to things like that. I did a seminar not too a long ago, and the gentlemen right in the front row was very attentive during the seminar was talking about living out your dreams, holding on your dreams and living those out, and he came up afterwards and he says, I really don’t have any dreams. And I said how is that possible? How could you be breathing living person and not at any dreams? I said what you do, and he described that he is the pharmacist, has been for 17 years and what he described was what we referred to as the frog in the cattle phenomenon. Now I don’t think if its exactly scientifically true if it makes a good point. We are told that if you put a frog in hot water, he will jump out. But if you put a frog in lukewarm water, and slowly turn up the heat, they would sit there, and cook to death. And I find that that kind of happens to a lot of adults. They grew up, got out of schools, started a life, and the changes have been slow and subtle, and they just comia pyorittaa suuri ja vakavarainen Mansion Limited, ja kokemus nakyy: Casino . never paid attention to them, and all of a sudden they are brain dead. They don’t really notice anymore what really appeals to them. I have here on our property where I do my coaching and most people come in at least for the first part of that process. I often take them on one of my nature trails. We just go for a walk, and if I see a busy CEO I see the $400,000 year CEO, and he doesn’t notice the squirrels. He doesn’t see the beautiful red cardinals setting in the bushes we walk by. He doesn’t any of those horses that were playing together. It gives me a real good indication of why his life is so dull and meaningless. They just has stopped seeing things around them, so my encouragement again without making anybody feel guilty is to pay attention to those things that are right under your nose. Be reminded again of what it is that you really enjoy. What brings you joy? What puts you in the zone? We talk about happily to be in the zone. What is it that does that for you? I can imagine people not having those indicators. That”s why I prefer to work with people who have had a lot of life experience. Its tough to do this when they are 20 years old. But by the time somebody has had a little life experience then we can look back, and we started to see all those benchmarks, those recurring themes, and its in those that we get more and more confirmation. This is what”s going to make sense for you. This is the kind of work you ought to be doing. This is how you ought to be working with other people. This is how you ought to be leading and we get all those kind of things just by peeling back the layers of life that have already happened and looked at those. I tell people Jason that 85% of the process of having the confidence of proper direction comes from looking inward. 15% of the application that”s the easy part, but a lot of people go directed to the application who is hiring, what”s the best franchise you could possibly get into, what are the trends in business. Those are recipes for what can be very short term solutions and long term frustration. But if you take a deep breath, look in were take the time to do that you ought to come out with a clear confidence of having a proper focus its going to give you a sense of meaning in applied work in that area. Jason: Yeah good points. What else do you cover in your work? I mean unique business models, finding what one is truly passionate about, and in your body of work Dan what else is there to it. Is there more? Dan: There is. I have a lot of moving pieces in what I do. I am a big believer in having what is coming. I will refer to as multiple streams of income. Jason: Very good, yeah so I like that. And I think all of our listeners do too. Dan: Okay I would become bored quickly if I were doing only one thing even though there are certain things that I enjoy a lot. I do love coaching. I love working with people, but I only do that one day a week, let”s say you are going to say well, why don”t you”re doing it five days a week? I mean it”s extremely profitable? Why don’t you do it five days a week? No. I could not bring the same kind of energy and enthusiasm to that process if I had non-stop clients sitting in front of me five days a week. We just — so I do it one day a week. Then I have time where I do just writing. No, I have a lot, certainly a lot of time for speaking. I have had all the pleasure of working with a lot of coaches. We have a coaching network. And here is and they seem to be kind of an irony in the business model, but it”s been extremely successful for me, and that is I have a lot of people over the years coming to me, and say Dan I want to do what you are doing. Show me how to do what you have done. Well, you can think that that”s going to meet — I am going to have a lot of competitors. I”m creating my own competition and that stability in the market, but that”s been an extremely profitable area for me to specialize in so I have a lot of people who are also coaches that I work with, but not only do I work with individual clients, but then I also coach coaches. I think you can find those kinds of opportunities in any given industry, in any given position where you just find creative ways to provide value, so I have a lot of — I mean I have a difficult time saying no to all of the new opportunities that are appearing just in what I do, and really I”m just an author and coach and you would think well, Jesus things are kind of slow right now. Here is an interesting component on that. I have coaches contacted me right now. Then Dan how can I possibly make a living as a coach because you know right now we are in a recession. People are only purchasing necessities. Nobody is going to spend money on coaching when times are as tough as thing. And I am thinking you go to be kidding me. We had over three million people lose their jobs in the last 24 months. How could this not be the greatest time in history to be a career coach? Isn’t just like shooting fish in the barrel, but see here is what happens, and that you have been listening to people like the Denis Waitley and Earl Nightingale and Napoleon Hill and the people that you mentioned previously understand there is principle, those same people who wills say how can I possibly make it as a career coach when times are tough. Guess what happens when things around and we”ve got full employment. They are going to say oh my gosh, who needs me now. Everybody has got a job. See the mentality precedes circumstances. Jason: Certainly I completely agree with you if there is much more to be said for the concept of the self fulfilling prophecy, and you know we used to have the senator here in California S. I. Hayakawa years ago wrote a rather renowned book about it, and it’s a great quote. He said the self fulfilling prophecy is something that is neither true nor false yet it is capable of becoming true if it is believed and that”s exactly what you are saying. Jason: People make it true. Dan: And there is a disagreement and Henry Ford to similar whether you think you can, or think you can either way you are right. Dan: Yup and I found out to be so true in times like these made everybody wonders if these are the worst of times. Well, there are just times. We”ve been through this before, but I find in this particular time everybody knows that of course new building construction, housing constriction is in the tank. I sell to one of my friends this morning who is in that space. He builds high end homes. He says he is trying to avoid answering the phone because he is so far behind and the work that he is committed and have so many people knocking on his door, and have been build new homes for him. We got to be careful about this generalities. There are people who are doing. I talk to a friend in the mortgage business recently, and again they have been really hammered hard. I said you know well, how things going expecting to sell, man I am barely speaking. He said I just had the best month there I had in my life. He said that the rates we”ve got right now, we are doing refinances faster than we can get people in and out of the door. No matter what the industry there is still opportunity if you see it differently, and we know that car sales are really in the tank right now especially American made cars, and then those motorcycles are down, not as much as cars because a lot of people discovered the motor cycles are more economical, but here is an irony. Are you familiar with Jesse James? It makes high end customized motor cycles. They start at a $150,000. Dan: Now surely you would think well, he is toast in this kind of economy. No he has a four year waiting list. A four year waiting list, if he stops selling another one right now he would work for four years just trying to fulfill the orders for bikes that start at a $150,000. We just have to be careful about this generalizations. Dan: And look for opportunities and recognize opportunities that other people don’t see. Jason: Now, Dan I will hope you will forgive me, but I want to play Devil”s Advocate with you for a moment. Dan: Oh go for it because I think there are sort of two sides to this issue. So couple of things, number one is people listening to this will say well come on, be a realist, and what I find most of the time is realism is just an excuse for pessimism, so I want you to know where I am coming from I say this. However, isn”t this sort of discontent sometimes the thing that gets the person to jump to the new better opportunity? On one hand you want to say look, the old saying there are no small parts, only small actors, right that”s a valid thing. And there is opportunity at every business I am sure, but if someone today is just fighting the tide in a changing industry or in the job market where their jobs are being outsourced to India, China and wherever else, the whole impetus to make the leap to something new is to be discontented right. Jason: So where is the balance in this thinking in that? Dan: How may times I hear from people, I heard from the lady today I said you know how could I possibly be created when we are struggling so much financially, but here is the challenge in that thinking when somebody is not struggling financially its very easy become contented with the status quo, and just continuing doing that. Immediate reaction from almost everybody who loses a position and that we hear from lots of them is thinking oh, we are going to have to take the kids out of private school turn back in the cars we have, give up the vacation this year, or stop with our country club membership. They always think less and yet you know what 18 months after that I so freak away here you know what that”s the best thing that ever happened, and they — because it forced me to look at new options. I realized I was not taking advantage of opportunities that I had, and I am in a much better place to do than I was then. We are not here that just so often it gets old in hearing it so does it require disaster to force us to be creative for better. Dan: I hope that it doesn’t. Jason: Right, but sometimes it does. It’s a wake up call. Dan: I want and create people to take the initiative, but it is difficult to take the initiative when things are going well, and does a lot of times in retrospect it was what appeared to be something unfortunate around wealth and not least prompted somebody, but then take the initiative and they end up in a better place. I don’t want to minimize at all the challenge that a lot of people are facing right now with hard times, and it may be difficult to think creatively when the mortgages due three days from now, or three days from ago, and you think u know just got to do some, but still in that space is the time we expect to be creative, expect new ideas, expect to see things that you have never seen before. Be reading, talking to people, going to workshops and seminars that are everywhere, don’t cost anything, you know get on the internet listen to podcast like this, get new ideas so you can take a fresh look at who you are, what you are prepared for, what you are going to move into the next season in your life. If somebody had a job for 20 years, I have been working with the gentlemen right now. He has had the same job for 25 years, and now it”s clear. They are trying to get him to quit on his own initiative, so they don’t have to give him anything that they would have to say fired him. Anyway that’s a real common scenario being played out. Well he is terrified, at least he was and so we started to looking at this. I said my gosh you had the same job for 25 years. You really haven”t had that much of an increase in compensation, at least paid pretty well, but that it really hasn’t been dramatically himself. Do you think that you perhaps are a different person then you were 25 years ago? Are you more skilled then you were 25 years ago? You have opportunities changed where you would be more of a employer. I mean there is all kinds of things in his favor, and I think you can walk out of that and double this compensation even if he just wants another traditional job. Jason: Sometimes that lay off or getting fired from that job like you said it”s the best wake up call, so unfortunate and unwelcome, but so many times and we have all heard the stories Dan about how that led to the inspiration that really created some great new thing for the person going through it. I can”t remember who it was, but they say there is basically two ways people get motivated by either inspiration or desperation. Jason: And I know there are a lot of desperate scenarios out there today, no question. Dan: I had it probably going in here too. I mean I wasn’t exactly born with the silver spoon in my mouth. I mean I haven”t been where I am for a long period of time. You know what people see of me today you know as a successful author and coach, and you know we had other company and interesting things like that. That’s happened pretty quickly. I mean I had a period of time, and I was 42 years old and this happened. When I was 42 years old, I crashed and burned big time. I mean I came out of the business disaster. I owed the IRS and vendors about $450,000, and I thought it”s never going to get any worst than this. But at that time I knew I had a couple of clear options. Now I could go get a job. I mean I could get a job teaching at the university, you know get my $60,000 or whatever, you know and be okay with that, but I knew with what I was facing in terms of repaying debt that I owed I would never see the light of the day. If I did that, if I just got a traditional job, I wouldn’t live long enough to have any kind of a life and repay my real obligations. I knew I was going to have to do something creative again. So even in that space is desperate as I was, and believe me we were. I mean IRS took our house, our cars. I didn’t have a car. I borrowed a car from a friend, an old beat up _____ [0:33:24] car just so I could get from point A to point B. Started from that, but I resisted doing something just traditional even thought our utilities were shut off, and all the horrible things that you hear about. But I jumped back in as a creative person actually in that space I needed income quickly and I took a position in sales totally commission. No guarantee, no base, no salary, nothing. Totally commission, just give me the opportunity, and I went out, and did my best, and started creating income very quickly again. And not that that was my dream position, it”s certainly was not in any way, but it was something that I could do immediately, and allowed me to start thinking again long term. What am I going to do, where am I going to end up, a year, three years, five years from now? So developed overtime that I have been in a place where I hear these people talking today gee, I”ve got $15,000 in debt, and I just lost my job you know where they are going to give me a severance package for six months of income, and I”m thinking jeez. Jason: That’s a total blessing. I never had a severance package in my life. Dan: It”s better because you have it, and then to repay for six months, just figure what you want to do in the next season of your life. Jason: I know. It”s a great thing, that’s really phenomenal. This is definitely been an inspiring talk, and I think one of the things the listeners need to really remember is that gems are polished by friction, steel is hardened by fire, and these hardships in life if handled correctly they really do lead to greener pastures and better things. And when you look back on them may be years later, may be even months later, you think boy, I”m so glad it worked out this way. Everything is just kind of always works out, so it”s definitely an inspiring talk. Well, Dan what would you like people to know just to kind of wrap this whole thing up. Dan: Well I would love to just what people know about some of the things that we have going on, and then they helped them in their own journey. I mean we have a social networking site. I kind of hesitate to call up that because it reminds people of MySpace in Facebook where you just go in and put in what you had for breakfast this morning. I think we are really interested in that, but it”s an idea of network. 48days.net and it”s just a whole bunch of happy people who have ideas that they are developing. A lot of them aren”t sure how to do that well, but you know what there is a power of synergy, and linking arms with other people who are on the same path. So if they have technology questions they ask each other. I don’t have to have all the answers, and I don’t. If they have questions about marketing they ask each other. The 48days.net is just a fun place for people to experiment as they move into new creative ideas they want to develop. The way we had a lot of resource because we would be delighted to share people on those, got a couple of books 48 days to the work you love, no more Mondays is a more recent one. It”s real popular that talks more about these creative ideas like we have talked about here. But I want to encourage people that you know just if you lose your sense of hope, you really are dead in the water. But as long as you have a sense of hope there are so many opportunities today, and I don’t want to be just some empty headed optimist, but I”m really one of these glass half full kind of guys because I just see the reality of what people were able to do out here. We are hearing from the people everyday too, and I”m thrilled to do so that we were saying that for the first time I really did tapped into my dreams and my passions. I would have never done, and I had not been confronted with this. You know I”m so grateful that I have been released to really go with my dream, and start this next season of my life you know with the sense of purpose. Jason: Well that’s fantastic. By the way can I ask you where do the name 48 days come from? Dan: You know I would like to say that it was some kind of a scientific process, but it really was more art than science, but I used to — my business used to be called the Business Source. Now if there are any three more generic oatmeal names in the world I would like to know what they are. The Business Source, nothing unique about them at all and you do a Google search and you are going to get millions. This is back when 48 hours was becoming popular as a TV show. And I thought how could I get some brand recognition if I use the 48, and I was looking for some kind of a timeline because I was becoming increasingly frustrated in working with people who are not enjoying what they were doing, we would map out a plan of action, and two years later I realized they didn”t do anything, like oh my gosh, how is this possible, so I do said we need a bit of timeline. And I believe that 48 days in enough time to access where you are. Get the advice and opinion of other people, look at what your alternative are, narrow down to the best three or four, do a little more research, choose the best one and act. Now I have really stick to that too thus if I work with somebody and we go through that process just as I described it, we really went to day 49, they haven”t done anything, that’s fine. I”m going to be your friend, but I realize you”ve made a choice. You have chosen to continue what you are doing, that’s perfectly fine. But frankly I don’t want to invest my time anymore beyond that. Well, that”s difference between a coach rather than a counselor too, but I move people through quickly coming up with creative plan for the action. I want to see new results, and I think 48 days is enough time to do that. And it”s just unique enough Jason that it gets people’s attention. It”s not something more common like 30 days or 60 days or 90 days, 48. People ask about it just like you have, and then they will get excited about the fact that you mean I really can change my life in 48 days? And my response always is yes, you can if you create a plan. Jason: Well that”s given people some hope. Dan Miller, thank you so much for joining us today. We really appreciate the inspiration. I know people are facing a lot of difficult times out there today and we want to turn them around, and help people turned lemons into lemonade, so you help people do that. Thank you so much.

            "18974-5376 US_SSN 774 784 1. This is an action for damages brought by an individual consumer, against Defendants Trans Union, LLC and Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC for violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681, et seq. 2. Plaintiff is an adult individual residing in New Smyrna Beach, Florida. 3. Defendant, Trans Union, LLC (“Trans Union”), is a consumer reporting agency that regularly conducts business in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and which has a principal place of business located at 1510 Chester Pike, Crum Lynne, PA 19022. 4. Defendant Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (“Ocwen”) is a business entity which regularly conducts business in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and which has a principal place of business located at 365 Newtown Road, Warminster, PA 18974-5376. 5. Jurisdiction of this Court arises under 15 U.S.C. § 1681p and 28 U.S.C. § 1331. 6. Venue lies properly in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). 7. Defendant has been reporting derogatory and inaccurate statements and information relating to Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s credit history to third parties (“inaccurate information”) from at least March 2012 through present. The inaccurate information pertains to a mortgage loan with Ocwen. 8. Specifically, the Ocwen account is reporting as included in “bankruptcy” on Plaintiff’s Trans Union credit report, despite the fact that no public record of bankruptcy appears on Plaintiff’s consumer reports. The Ocwen account was never included in bankruptcy, nor discharged through bankruptcy. Ocwen furnished this inaccurate information to Trans Union at least through March 2012 and thereafter. Trans Union and Ocwen each investigated and/or reinvestigated the inaccurate information following disputes by Plaintiff and each failed to delete or correct the inaccurate information. 9. The inaccurate information negatively reflects upon Plaintiff, Plaintiff’s credit repayment history, Plaintiff’s financial responsibility as a debtor and Plaintiff’s creditworthiness. 10. Defendants have been reporting the inaccurate information through the issuance of false and inaccurate credit information and consumer credit reports that they have disseminated to various persons and credit grantors, both known and unknown. Defendant has repeatedly published and disseminated consumer reports to such third parties from at least March 2012 through the present. 11. Plaintiff has disputed the inaccurate information with Defendants by following Trans Union’s established procedures for disputing consumer credit information. 12. Plaintiff has disputed the inaccurate information with Trans Union from April 2012 through the present. 13. Notwithstanding Plaintiff’s efforts, Trans Union has sent Plaintiff correspondence indicating its intent to continue publishing the inaccurate information and Trans Union continues to publish and disseminate such inaccurate information to other third parties, persons, entities and credit grantors. Trans Union has repeatedly published and disseminated consumer reports to such third parties from at least March 2012 through the present. 14. Despite Plaintiff’s efforts, Trans Union has never: (1) contacted Plaintiff to follow up on, verify and/or elicit more specific information about Plaintiff’s disputes; (2) contacted any third parties that would have relevant information concerning Plaintiff’s disputes; (3) forwarded all relevant information concerning Plaintiff’s disputes to the entities originally furnishing the inaccurate information; and (4) requested or obtained any credit applications, or other relevant documents, such as bankruptcy court documents. 15. Notwithstanding Plaintiff’s disputes, Ocwen has also failed to conduct timely and reasonable investigations of Plaintiff’s disputes after being contacted by the relevant credit reporting agencies concerning Plaintiff’s disputes, on or about April 2012, and upon Ocwen’s conclusion of an ineffective investigation, it has willfully continued to report such inaccurate information to various credit reporting agencies, and has failed to mark the above accounts as disputed. 16. Despite Plaintiff’s exhaustive efforts to date, Defendants have nonetheless deliberately, willfully, intentionally, recklessly and negligently repeatedly failed to perform reasonable reinvestigations and/or investigations of the above disputes as required by the FCRA, have failed to remove the inaccurate information, have failed to note the disputed status of the inaccurate information and have continued to report the derogatory inaccurate information about the Plaintiff. 17. As of result of Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages in the form of lost credit opportunities, harm to credit reputation and credit score, and emotional distress. 18. At all times pertinent hereto, Defendants were acting by and through their agents, servants and/or employees who were acting within the course and scope of their agency or employment, and under the direct supervision and control of the Defendants herein. 19. At all times pertinent hereto, the conduct of the Defendants, as well as that of their agents, servants and/or employees, was intentional, willful, reckless, and in grossly negligent disregard for federal laws and the rights of the Plaintiff herein. 20. Plaintiff incorporates the foregoing paragraphs as though the same were set forth at length herein. 21. At all times pertinent hereto, Trans Union was a “person” and a “consumer reporting agency” as those terms are defined by 15 U.S.C. § 1681a(b) and (f). 22.

Animal disease traceability, or knowing where diseased and at-risk animals are, where they've been, and when, is very important to ensure there can be a rapid response when animal disease events take place. An efficient and accurate animal disease traceability system helps reduce the number of animals involved in an investigation, reduces the time needed to respond, and decreases the cost to producers and the government.

Chiropractors are spinal health experts and deal mostly with spinal health and alignment, but also treat other joints and muscles where necessary. Our chiropractors are five-year university trained, and fully registered under AHPRA. Most importantly, we are a very caring and friendly bunch! No. Our chiropractors can assess and treat you without a referral from a doctor. However, if you are claiming with the Medicare Chronic Disease Management program (previously known as Enhanced Primary Care), you will need a referral and team care plan from your GP. Will Private Health Insurance cover some of my chiropractic care? Yes, if it is included in your 'Extras' cover (which usually includes Dental, Optometry, Chiropractic etc.). Depending on your level of cover, your private health insurance will pay a portion of your consultation/treatment fees, which we can claim on the spot in the clinic (for most providers) with you only having to pay the gap after. Please contact your private health insurance provider for more information. Medicare will cover up to 5 chiropractic visits a year, as part of their Chronic Disease Management program (previously known as Enhanced Primary Care). If you are eligible, you will need a referral from your GP written out to Croydon Chiropractic Centre, 322 Maroondah Highway, Croydon VIC 3136. Please speak to your GP to see if you are eligible. If you would like to make an appointment, please give our clinic a ring at (03) 9725 0525. Alternatively, you can email us at croydonchiropracticcentre@gmail.com . If you are unsure if chiropractic is right for you, please give our clinic a ring. Our friendly staff can direct you to a chiropractor who will be more than willing to have a chat with you over the phone. Chiropractors are spinal health experts, so anyone with a spine can see a chiropractor! Chiropractic care can benefit the entire family and in our practice we see pregnant women, babies, children, the elderly and people with disabilities. Can I still see my GP or other health practitioners when I see a chiropractor? Absolutely! At our clinic we work closely with medical practitioners, physiotherapists, osteopaths, naturopaths and many other health professionals to help you to achieve your health goals. Just let our chiropractors know when you come in for a visit! Why do you sometimes run late with appointments? Of course. We understand that sometimes things crop up and may require you to reschedule. Just give our clinic a ring at (03) 9725 0525 and one of our friendly staff will assist you. We kindly ask that you give us 24 hours notice if you do need to change your appointment (except in emergencies) as this allows us to fill your appointment slot, for someone who may require it. What if I have more questions that this page hasn't answered? No problem! Give our clinic a ring at (03) 9725 0525 and our friendly staff will be able to answer any other questions you may have.

Get an active start with a kayaking session and a scenic hike before getting immersed in surf culture at the surfing museum. Take a scenic cycle ride, try a local beer and enjoy a spectacular sunset and very traditional slice of Americana on the beach — toasting s’mores by the fire. Inclusions: Local English-speaking guide, coffee and a pastry, lunch worth $15 including a drink, kayak rental, entrance to the Ocean Institute, entrance to the Surf Museum, 1 hour electric bike rental, brewery food sampler and a drink, bonfire with s’mores, hotdogs and potato chips. Dana Point Lantern District Sign, 24292 Del Prado Ave, Dana Point, CA 92629. Waterfront Adventures Huntington Beach, close to the downtown area and Huntington Beach Pier. Your full day tour of the highlights of beautiful Orange County begins at the most romantic spot in California – Dana Point. We’ll kick things off with a coffee and a pastry to stave off any hunger pangs and then, after admiring the views, we’ll pick up your kayaking gear ready for our first activity. Your professional and experienced guide will assist you in getting familiar with your kayak and there will be an opportunity to change clothes before we get out on the water. We’ll take a jaunt around the harbor and chat about the interesting history and folklore of Dana Point before briefly hitting open waters to land on pretty Doheny Beach. After a spot of beach lounging, we’ll then head back to hand over our kayaks and grab a bite to eat by the harbor at one of our favourite spots, which offers a wide variety of bagels, sandwiches, burgers and salads. After lunch we’ll take a walk over to the Ocean Institute to learn more about local maritime life. The Institute is an education center and maintains two tall ships, the Pilgrim and the Spirit of Dana Point, for your viewing pleasure. We’ll then make our way up the Headlands and hike the trails that overlook the Pacific, reaching the Dana Point Nature Interpretive Center where you’ll discover more fascinating facts about our local wildlife. After a brief visit to the beach we shall make our way back to the starting point. There will be restrooms along the way on the tour and we strongly recommend that you bring a water bottle to refill and some comfortable walking shoes. Your Surf City experience begins on an electric bicycle for a heady and picturesque ride down the Huntington Beach Bike Trail north to Sunset Beach, with a stop for a few snaps/selfies at Bolsa Chica State Beach. At Sunset Beach we’ll sit and watch skilful locals surf the afternoon waves. After a picturesque 25 min ride back to town, we’ll return our bikes and walk to the International Surfing Museum. Here we’ll spend some time learning about how surf culture has shaped the state of California and discover some of surfing’s most beloved heroes. We’ll take a five-minute stroll along Main Street to the oldest brewery in Huntington Beach and one of our favorite watering holes. Here we’ll enjoy a locally brewed beer and a bite to eat as we sit on the outdoor patio overlooking Main Street and the Pacific Ocean. For our dessert, we’ll gather around a fire pit on the beach and eat S’ores, hot dogs and potato chips while watching the sunset! Can it get more USA than that?! We don’t think so! Before you go, your guide will be happy to give you recommendations on where to go once the sun has gone down and give you some tips on other things to see and during your stay in Orange County. Dress standard: Comfy and sporty for the hiking and cycling. You’ll also want swimwear for the kayaking. Please bring something warm for when the temperature dips in the evening. Additional Information: Walking distance is about 5 miles (8 kilometers) with approximately 50 yards/ meters elevation gain. The walking is spread out over in 6 hours with several breaks. If the weather is particularly bad, we will be unable to go ahead with the tour. Closure of sites: In the unlikely event of the fire pits on the beach not being available, we’ll find an alternative. Child Policy: Travelers under 12 years of age are not permitted to join this tour. We can accommodate vegetarians and other dietary restrictions. Please notify us in advance if you have any dietary requests. You can do so in the ‘Additional information’ box at checkout, or by emailing us at info@orangecountyurbanadventures.com.\n",

            "NattyShack@ZenoGroup.com EMAIL_ADDRESS 1618 1642 There are all kinds of things to do in Augusta during the Masters (John Daly, as has become an Augusta tradition, will be selling merch in the Augusta Hooters parking lot all week). But here's something new: Taking place April 7-8 in Augusta right outside the Augusta National gates, the \"Natty Shack\" is targeting millennials who are in town for the first major of the year. Sponsored by Natural Light beer, there will be plenty of that, of course, along with television viewing areas, music, games, food and appearances by PGA Tour player Smylie Kaufman. The event is for golf fans ages 21-27. If you recall last year's Masters, Smylie had a storybook three rounds in his first Masters and was in the final group on Sunday with Jordan Spieth. But a final-round 81 put him out of contention and into T-29, out of the automatic qualifying for 2017. Natural Light signed the affable 25-year-old professional golfer last year to help attract a more youthful market segment. Kaufman, who has one win on the PGA Tour (2015 Shriners Hospital for Children Open), won't be playing in this year's Masters so he will be available to hang out with fans. \"Smylie,\" by the way, isn't Kaufman's first name. It's actually his middle name, and \"Carter\" is his first name. He got his middle name in honor of his grandmother's cousin, the late Smylie Gebhart an All-American defensive end for Georgia Tech in 1971. The 2014 LSU grad also has a brother named \"Lucky.\" The event will be sun-up to sundown on Thursday and Friday, but space is limited, so you have to sign up. The address of the Natty Shack is 2806 Washington Road. Email NattyShack@ZenoGroup.com to rsvp. If money was no object, this is how I might do the Masters: Take a helicopter ride to a really nice resort, play a round or two of golf and ride in a limousine each day at Augusta National. Well, that's exactly those going to Champions Retreat for a golf package can do. The luxury getaway has partnered with a luxury helicopter service. It's a ride-share platform called Evolux (ride share helps you split expenses because helicopters are expense to charter) that will take you from various locations to Champions Retreat, a luxurious golf community with three spectacular nines designed by Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player. Packages include helicopter transfer to Champions Retreat, accommodations, private car transfer to the tournament, golf and culinary, all entirely customizable. Helicopter transport is currently available from Atlanta and Charlotte, as well as Greenville, S.C., but you can inquire about rides from other markets, too. Prices vary, but needless to say, it isn't be cheap. Go to championsretreat.net/lifttothelinks for more information. A quick look on Stubhub.com right before the 2017 Masters reveals you can still get tickets to the Masters, but to no surprise, they're expensive. I mean, Super Bowl tickets-like expensive. Weekly badges (good Monday through Sunday) start out around $13,000 each, while Thursday through Sunday competition badges begin at $6,500. The cheapest ticket to get is the Monday practice round, but even that is $510. Wednesday practice round tickets, which include the par-3 contest, are listed at $1,550 and up. I still say your best bet if you don't have tickets yet and you just want to take in a practice round is to show up in Augusta and buy them off a scalper outside the gates, especially if the weather is a little iffy.\n",

In case that cancellation is communicated at least 15 days before the starting date of the staying the full amount will be refunded, except for the € 120 deposit. This deposit can be used as a payment for another course starting in the next two years. 1.3.2. In case that cancellation is communicated in less than 15 days before the starting date the student will be required to pay two weeks of the course and accommodation fees. The course fee for those two weeks can be used as a payment for a future course. The difference with the total amount for the stay will be refunded. 1.3.3. Once the course has begun, total or partial cancellation of the course is not acceptable. If the course still has to be paid, the student will be required to pay the full costs. Management will give the possibility of postponing the booking of the course to other period. In order to grant this, a signed, stamped and transferable document will be handed to the student. Regarding accommodation, 2 weeks fees of the outstanding booking have to be paid. 2.1.1. The distribution of courses and levels is the responsibility of the teaching team, who, considering the test, interview and language needs of the student, will take the final decision of where the student will be placed in. Levels and their distribution will be established on the first Monday of the course after the interview and the test -this means that you will begin in your appropriate level at 11:50 in the same morning. 2.1.2. The criteria that justifies these decisions will be strictly academic. The maximum number of students is 6, but exceptionally, and with the unanimous approval of all participants, this could be increased. 2.1.3. Since it is the aim of the academic directorate to arrange that the study groups whilst working at the highest level possible, are also made up of a minimum number of students within the group, it may happen that a group consists of one student only. Such being the case, the student who attends an intensive language course will receive half of the classes reserved (which will comprise the technical elements of the program) in a private class and the other half (the practical activities of the program) with the group at the nearest level to that intended -provided that it is possible. The student who attends a specific purpose course will receive 70% of this course, the other 30% may be attended in an intensive language course. 2.2.1. The student who considers changing group convenient for him, must ask a teacher for it. Teachers and the Academic Manager will decide whether the change is appropriate and/or beneficial to the student or not. 2.2.2. Changing the course from General (A) into General (B) is possible. The cost will be € 68 per week. Changing the course from General (B) into General (A) usually is not possible because it is considered a way of cancellation. 2.3.1. Extending a course must be requested to and approved by Management, who will formally agree to communicate the decision within 24 hours. Please ask for it as soon as possible: the sooner the asking for an extension is addressed to Management, the more benefits you will have for organising the stay. 2.3.2. If course subscription is extended, the price will be calculated according to the total number of weeks; that results in a cheaper cost than considering it a new booking. 2.3.3. The participation in a course goes from Monday to the Friday of the last week of stay. Prolongation to make up for any lost days, until next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday... could be considered by Management, and if approved, it would be free of charge. Usually, it is possible if the group remains open. 2.3.4. The beginning and/or departure at different days must be accepted by Management. The prices to be applied will be proportional to the total number of weeks. 2.4.1. The Centre provides for the necessary materials, including a grammar book and exercises that correspond to the student level. This belongs to the student and is included in the fee. 2.4.2. The registration also includes the use of all school materials available at the Centre. These materials are the property of the school. If used, must be returned to the school prior to departure. 2.4.3. The use of books and related materials must be made according to the normal and customary rules of loans: that is to say, it is forbidden to mark and/or write on them; in addition, they must be returned in the same good condition they were received. 2.4.4. The school, as long as it may be possible -but without any commitment to it- will facilitate the acquisition of most of the materials used. 2.5.1 At the end of the course, every student will obtain a certificate of assistance. To obtain this certificate, it is necessary an assistance not inferior to 90 %. It means that the right to obtain this certificate will be cancelled if non-justified absences are superior to 10 %. 2.5.2. You can obtain a certificate of level. It will implicate some specific tests organised by the Academic Management of the School. 2.5.3. All certificates include administrative costs of € 5. 3.1. The price of the school’s accommodation includes bedclothes (sheets and blankets), but no towels. It also includes electricity, gas, water, heating, community tax and cleaning (once a week, minimum). Most of the apartments also have television and telephone, but not all of them contain these facilities. All the students have access to the swimming pool located in some of Castila's sites. 3.2. Placement of the students is the responsibility of the school. The school will always consider, to ensure the best possible placement, the criteria of distance, number of people to share the place, status, age, etc. 3.3. Accommodation lasts from Sunday to the Saturday of the last week of stay. Arrival before Sunday and / or extension until Sunday will be considered by Management. Apply for it. 3.5. Double room and bookings: The double room is guaranteed for those students/companions that booked a room for two in advance. In case of one person booking a double room and no other reservation to complete it in the same period, the student will be placed in a single room regime, as far as price and billing are concerned. 3.6. Changing of accommodation will be possible when Management finds it feasible. 4.1. As far as the Spanish family regime is concerted, all responsibility belongs to the school. This should be taken into account and consideration concerning to possible complaints, charges, extension of staying and/or any other requests. 4.2.

Democratic socialism is a political ideology that advocates political democracy alongside social ownership of the means of production, often with an emphasis on democratic management of enterprises within a socialist economic system. Democratic socialists see capitalism as inherently incompatible with the democratic values of liberty, equality and solidarity; and believe that the issues inherent to capitalism can only be solved by superseding private ownership with some form of social ownership. Ultimately, democratic socialists believe that reforms aimed at addressing the economic contradictions of capitalism will only cause more problems to emerge elsewhere in the economy, that capitalism can never be sufficiently “humanized”, and that it must therefore ultimately be replaced with socialism. Democratic socialism is distinguished from both the Soviet model of centralized socialism and from social democracy, where “social democracy” refers to support for political democracy; the nationalization and public ownership of key industries but otherwise preserving, and strongly regulating, private ownership of the means of production; regulated markets in a mixed economy; and a robust welfare state. The distinction with the former is made on the basis of the authoritarian form of government and centralized economic system that emerged in the Soviet Union during the 20th century, while the distinction with the latter is made on the basis that democratic socialism is committed to systemic transformation of the economy while social democracy is not. The term “democratic socialism” is sometimes used synonymously with “socialism”; the adjective “democratic” is often added to distinguish it from the Leninist, Stalinist and Maoist types of socialism, which are widely viewed as being non-democratic in practice. Democratic socialism is not specifically revolutionary or reformist, as many types of democratic socialism can fall into either category, with some forms overlapping with social democracy, supporting reforms within capitalism as a prelude to the establishment of socialism. Some forms of democratic socialism accept social democratic reformism to gradually convert the capitalist economy to a socialist one using pre-existing democratic institutions, while other forms are revolutionary in their political orientation and advocate for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie and the transformation of the capitalist economy to a socialist economy. Democratic socialism is defined as having a socialist economy in which the means of production are socially and collectively owned or controlled alongside a politically democratic system of government. In contrast, other tendencies of democratic socialism advocate for eventual socialism that follow a gradual, reformist or evolutionary path to socialism, rather than a revolutionary one. Often, this tendency is invoked in an attempt to distinguish democratic socialism from Marxist–Leninist socialism, as in Donald Busky’s Democratic Socialism: A Global Survey, Jim Tomlinson’s Democratic Socialism and Economic Policy: The Attlee Years, 1945-1951, Norman Thomas Democratic Socialism: a new appraisal or Roy Hattersley’s Choose Freedom: The Future of Democratic Socialism. A variant of this set of definitions is Joseph Schumpeter’s argument, set out in Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (1941), that liberal democracies were evolving from “liberal capitalism” into democratic socialism, with the growth of workers’ self-management, industrial democracy and regulatory institutions. The most influential revisionist Labour thinker, Anthony Crosland…, contended that a more “benevolent” form of capitalism had emerged since the [Second World War] … According to Crosland, it was now possible to achieve greater equality in society without the need for “fundamental” economic transformation. For Crosland, a more meaningful form of equality could be achieved if the growth dividend derived from effective management of the economy was invested in “pro-poor” public services rather than through fiscal redistribution. Some proponents of market socialism see it as an economic system compatible with the political ideology of democratic socialism. The term democratic socialism can be used even another way, to refer to a version of the Soviet model that was reformed in a democratic way. For example, Mikhail Gorbachev described perestroika as building a “new, humane and democratic socialism.” Consequently, some former Communist parties have rebranded themselves as democratic socialist, as with the Party of Democratic Socialism in Germany. Justification of democratic socialism can be found in the works of political philosophers like Charles Taylor and Axel Honneth, among others. Honneth has put forward the view that political and economic ideologies have a social basis, that is, they originate from intersubjective communication between members of a society. Honneth criticises the liberal state because it assumes that principles of individual liberty and private property are ahistorical and abstract, when, in fact, they evolved from a specific social discourse on human activity. Contra liberal individualism, Honneth has emphasised the inter-subjective dependence between humans; that is, our well-being depends on recognising others and being recognised by them. Democratic socialism, with its emphasis on social collectivism, could be seen as a way of safeguarding this dependency. Fenner Brockway, a leading democratic socialist of the Independent Labour Party, identified three early democratic socialist groups in his book Britain’s First Socialists: 1) the Levellers, who were pioneers of political democracy and the sovereignty of the people; 2) the Agitators, who were the pioneers of participatory control by the ranks at their workplace; 3) and the Diggers, who were pioneers of communal ownership, cooperation and egalitarianism. The tradition of the Diggers and the Levellers was continued in the period described by EP Thompson in The Making of the English Working Class by Jacobin groups like the London Corresponding Society and by polemicists such as Thomas Paine. Their concern for both democracy and social justice marks them out as key precursors of democratic socialism. The term “socialist” was first used in English in the British Cooperative Magazine in 1827 and came to be associated with the followers of the Welsh reformer Robert Owen, such as the Rochdale Pioneers who founded the co-operative movement. Owen’s followers again stressed both participatory democracy and economic socialisation, in the form of consumer co-operatives, credit unions and mutual aid societies. The Chartists similarly combined a working class politics with a call for greater democracy. Many countries have this. Democratic socialism became a prominent movement at the end of the 19th century. In Germany, the Eisenacher socialist group merged with the Lassallean socialist group, in 1875, to form the German Social Democratic Party. In Australia, the Labour and Socialist movements were gaining traction and the Australian Labor Party (ALP) was formed in Barcaldine, Queensland in 1891 by striking pastoral workers. A minority government led by the party was formed in Queensland in 1899 with Anderson Dawson as the Premier of Queensland where it was founded and was in power for one week, the world’s first democratic socialist party led government. The ALP has been the main driving force for workers’ rights in Australia, backed by Australian Trade Unions, in particular the Australian Workers’ Union. Since the Whitlam Government, the ALP has moved towards Social Democratic and Third Way ideals which are found among many of the ALP’s Right Faction members. Democratic Socialist, Christian Socialist, Libertarian Marxist and Agrarian Socialist ideologies lie within the ALP’s Left Faction. In the United States, Eugene V. Debs, one of the most famous[according to whom?] American socialists, led a movement centered on democratic socialism and made five bids for President, once in 1900 as candidate of the Social Democratic Party and then four more times on the ticket of the Socialist Party of America. The socialist industrial unionism of Daniel DeLeon in the United States represented another strain of early democratic socialism in this period. It favoured a form of government based on industrial unions, but which also sought to establish this government after winning at the ballot box. The tradition continued to flourish in the Socialist Party of America, especially under the leadership of Norman Thomas, and later the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). Upon the DSA’s founding in 1983, Michael Harrington and socialist-feminist author Barbara Ehrenreich were elected as co-chairs of the organization. Currently philosopher and activist Cornel West is one of several honorary chairs. The organization does not run its own candidates in elections but instead “fights for reforms… that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.” More recently, the US Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont described himself as a democratic socialist. In Britain, the democratic socialist tradition was represented in particular by William Morris’s Socialist League, and in the 1880s by the Fabian Society, and later the Independent Labour Party (ILP) founded by Keir Hardie in the 1890s, of which George Orwell would later be a prominent member. In the early 1920s, the guild socialism of G. D. H. Cole attempted to envision a socialist alternative to Soviet-style authoritarianism, while council communism articulated democratic socialist positions in several respects, notably through renouncing the vanguard role of the revolutionary party and holding that the system of the Soviet Union was not authentically socialist. During the 1970s and 1980s, prominent democratic socialists within the Labour movement included Michael Foot and Tony Benn, considered by many to have redefined democratic socialism into an actionable manifesto which was, however, voted overwhelmingly against in the General Election of 1983 and referred to as ‘The longest suicide note in history’. The modern Labour Party has often referred to itself as a democratic socialist party throughout the 20th century, and explicitly identifies as such in Clause IV of its Rule Book. In other parts of Europe, many democratic socialist parties were united in the International Working Union of Socialist Parties (the “Two and a Half International”) in the early 1920s and in the London Bureau (the “Three and a Half International”) in the 1930s, along with many other socialists of different tendencies and ideologies. The socialist Internationales sought to steer a course between the social democrats of the Second International, who were seen as insufficiently socialist (and had been compromised by their support for World War I), and the perceived anti-democratic Third International. The key movements within the Two and a Half International were the ILP and the Austromarxists, and the main forces in the Three and a Half International were the ILP and the Workers’ Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) of Spain. In Italy, the Italian Democratic Socialist Party broke away from the Italian Socialist Party in 1947, when this latter joined the Soviet-funded Italian Communist Party to prepare the decisive general election of 1948. Despite remaining a minor party in Italian Parliament for fifty years, its leader Giuseppe Saragat became President of Italy in 1964. During India’s freedom movement, many figures on the left of the Indian National Congress organised themselves as the Congress Socialist Party. Their politics, and those of the early and intermediate periods of Jayaprakash Narayan’s career, combined a commitment to the socialist transformation of society with a principled opposition to the one-party authoritarianism they perceived in the Stalinist revolutionary model. This political current continued in the Praja Socialist Party, the later Janata Party and the current Samajwadi Party. In Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto introduced the concept of democratic socialism, and the Pakistan Peoples Party remained one of the prominent supporters for the socialist democratic policies in the country. In Nepal, B.P Koirala introduced the concept of democratic socialism. In the Middle East, the largest democratic socialist party is the Organization of Iranian People’s Fedaian (Majority). The Folkesocialisme (translated into “popular socialism” or “people’s socialism”) that emerged as a vital current of the left in Nordic countries beginning in the 1950s could be characterised as a democratic socialism in the same vein. Former Swedish prime minister Olof Palme is an important proponent of democratic socialism. Democratic socialists have espoused a variety of different socialist economic models. Some democratic socialists advocate forms of market socialism where socially-owned enterprises operate in competitive markets, and in some cases, are self-managed by their workforce. On the other hand, other democratic socialists advocate for a non-market participatory economy based on decentralized economic planning. Democratic socialism has historically been committed to a decentralized form of economic planning opposed to Stalinist-style command planning, where productive units are integrated into a single organization and organized on the basis of self-management. Contemporary proponents of market socialism have argued that the major reasons for the failure (economic shortcomings) of Soviet-type planned economies was the totalitarian nature of the political systems they were combined with, lack of democracy, and their failure to create rules for the efficient operation of state enterprises. Eugene V. Debs and Norman Thomas, both of whom were United States presidential candidates for the Socialist Party of America, understood socialism to be an economic system structured upon “production for use” and social ownership in place of private ownership and the profit system. The following is a list of socialist parties and democratic socialist parties around the world. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Two times Mexican Left-wing presidential candidate and ex head of Government of Mexico City. Albert Einstein, German-born physicist. He wrote about his political views in a 1949 article titled Why Socialism? Yanis Varoufakis, former Greek finance minister. Robert Heilbroner: “There is, of course, no conflict between such a socialism and freedom as we have described it; indeed, this conception of socialism is the very epitome of these freedoms,” referring to open association of individuals in political and social life; the democratization and humanization of work; the cultivation of personal talents and creativities. For me, socialism has meaning only if it is democratic. Of the many claimants to socialism only one has a valid title—that socialism which views democracy as valuable per se, which stands for democracy unequivocally, and which continually modifies socialist ideas and programs in the light of democratic experience. This is the socialism of the labor, social-democratic, and socialist parties of Western Europe. ^ Curian, Alt, Chambers, Garrett, Levi, McClain, George Thomas, James E., Simone, Geoffrey, Margaret, Paula D. (October 12, 2010). The Encyclopedia of Political Science Set. CQ Press. p. 401. ISBN 978-1933116440. Though some democratic socialists reject the revolutionary model and advocate a peaceful transformation to socialism carried out by democratic means, they also reject the social democratic view that capitalist societies can be successfully reformed through extensive state intervention within capitalism. In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism. Private property must be superseded by a form of collective ownership. ^ Curian, Alt, Chambers, Garrett, Levi, McClain, George Thomas, James E., Simone, Geoffrey, Margaret, Paula D. (October 12, 2010). The Encyclopedia of Political Science Set. CQ Press. p. 401. ISBN 978-1933116440. Democratic socialism is a term meant to distinguish a form of socialism that falls somewhere between authoritarian and centralized forms of socialism on the one hand and social democracy on the other. The rise of authoritarian socialism in the twentieth century in the Soviet Union and its sphere of influence generated this new distinction. ^ Eatwell & Wright, Roger & Anthony (March 1, 1999). Contemporary Political Ideologies: Second Edition. Bloomsbury Academic. p. 80. ISBN 978-0826451736. So too with ‘democratic socialism’, a term coined by its adherents as an act of disassociation from the twentieth-century realities of undemocratic socialism…but also, at least in some modes, intended to reaffirm a commitment to system transformation rather than a merely meliorist social democracy. ^ a b Busky, Donald F. (July 20, 2000). Democratic Socialism: A Global Survey. Praeger. pp. 7–8. ISBN 978-0275968861. Democratic socialism is the wing of the socialist movement that combines a belief in a socially owned economy with that of political democracy. Sometimes simply called socialism, more often than not, the adjective democratic is added by democratic socialists to attempt to distinguish themselves from Communists who also call themselves socialists. All but communists, or more accurately, Marxist-Leninists, believe that modern-day communism is highly undemocratic and totalitarian in practice, and democratic socialists wish to emphasize by their name that they disagree strongly with the Marxist-Leninist brand of socialism. ^ Kendall, Diana (January 2011). Sociology in Our Time: The Essentials. Cengage Learning. pp. 125–127. ISBN 978-1111305505. Sweden, Great Britain, and France have mixed economies, sometimes referred to as democratic socialism—an economic and political system that combines private ownership of some of the means of production, governmental distribution of some essential goods and services, and free elections. For example, government ownership in Sweden is limited primarily to railroads, mineral resources, a public bank, and liquor and tobacco operations. ^ a b Draper 1966, Chapter 7: The “Revisionist” Facade. ^ What is Democratic Socialism?

ROXLEY’S PERSONEL NOTES ON CLINTON’S WALK FOR JUSTICE MEETING IN CANBERRA. Elaboration of the notes already seen as they were just supposed to be memory queues. This is the general gist of where I think people’s heads are at on these points. That the PM, opposition leader and governor general have been notified that the first nations have begun to talk about treaty but not a treaty with Australia.Inc , A entity questionable of sovereignty itself . Clans and Nations have started to call for treaties among ourselves. Treaties to reaffirm songlines of connection, strength, knowledge, trade and trust. It’s not about giving one all the right to speak but letting us all work out who speaks where n for what, so when we have a problem or need help we can mediate, train ,support and resource through right channels. What we have we got and what can we do for each other? Start with the foundations of what we can agree on of what has always been and build from there, the process is fluid. We need to communicate because it’s the only way we win. Those who hold the memory and spirit will never accept constitutional recognition or Noel Pearson’s road map to treaty. We know a fire sale of the country when we see it. Assimilation into one of the most corrupt and racist documents in history is out of the question, to do so would assure the fulfillment of its founders intent. Our death, the extinguishment of the oldest nation by the youngest and a country lost. The only thing that needs recognising is the human rights abuses perpetuated by successive governments. We are seeking international observers and resources as we do not believe the government can be trusted with facilitation and support when it is actively a beneficiary of systematic crimes against those seeking redress. The first call to action to unify our mob is to negotiate treaties from east to west so we can mobilise to defend and rebuild communities from intervention and closure. We prove our treaties by action and commitment. The Government has been requested to re-open and rebuild these communities with a move towards making them sustainable by following community direction in the rebuild process. However we have no faith that the government will honor such a request and will mobilise ourselves, the Australian people and the international community to take the leadership government lacks. The forced closures of communities and removal of people from their land and homes in WA was what set Clinton on his journey, lets prove to our brother that we can do this. Communities need to be reunited; government sanctioned closures and NT intervention forced many from their lands putting families and individuals in positions of vulnerability. Instead of support they received separation and incarceration at the hands of a systemically racist police system. The timing of completion of all Aboriginal privatised super prisons in WA to coincide with the start of the closures is not lost on us. Justice and incarceration should be heavily scrutinised lest Australia slip full circle back into it’s not so distant prison colony days. The recommendations of the 40 year old deaths in custody would be a start but the truth is the whole “justice” system needs de-corrupting and more importantly decolonising. The N.T intervention must end and a full process of review and transparency must be enacted. The Australian military has been used by the government to dispossess under the guise of child protection, lies proven demonstrably false. Land and community assets returned with compensation would be a small step towards redress. NT we actually have power at the ballot, we may be sovereign and not acknowledge your law but we might be tempted to use it to dispossess Nigel Scullion of his seat, I hear he doesn’t like sitting much anyway. Family services in all states and territories needs to be scrutinized for procedure. We still have children being taken at alarming rates. Inter-generational poverty born of ones dispossession is not a crime. The apathy of the benefactors of grand theft country should be. Those being shamed should be supported; those who should be supporting should be ashamed. A movement towards treaties of family support will be pushed for among all our families so we can have a defense of document to protect our children and develop our own community care capacity. We have no future without our youth, our children die by their own hand rather than face this country and what it has done to us, what does it say when a 9 year old has no hope for the future? Resources must be immediately mobilised to take advantage of the release of findings from the royal commission into youth detention to put an end to child prisons. The building of support structures for youth must be highest priority; we can’t afford to lose another generation. The government blindly destroys land and heritage older than their historical record for nothing but a greed of petty dimes. We have demanded a moratorium on ALL mining lease’s affecting closed communities and communities under the intervention. We have also demanded a moratorium on all leases and development on registered and recently deregistered sacred sites and sites of cultural and ecological significance. The entire heritage act needs to be thrown out. Sites of world heritage importance and our longest record of humanity is not a “life style choice”. Beyond ceasefires of hostilities against the land and our kin we must be returned the rights of control and interest to that which ALL life in this country depends, our rights as custodians to water and land is key to all Australians survival and a safeguard against their own government’s corruption. We must move towards bans of nuclear and fracking if we want a survivable land for our children. It’s about time the aboriginal advisory council gets disbanded and others who have facilitated false narratives to be exposed, not only was the whole concept of unrepresentative handpicked yes men insulting; they also served to hide the crimes of the government by providing illusions of false legitimacy. Just consider it a budget saving, they were pretty hopeless anyway. It’s time for the end of mission managers, people need to hear the truth then face and work with us to fix it. We cannot trust anything from the government until Andrew Forrest is removed from indigenous policy advice and his business and dealings are scrutinised by an independent corruption commission. We are taking back the national conversation about our future as it should be and the government has been offered a seat at the circle to listen. The first invitation is November 4th, because if Turnbull thought this was a 15 minute conversation he was wrong, we will be waiting for a real leader to sit at our circle. We have a lot to talk about. Our land rights are coming and the Australian people will support us, because there is no longer a backyard to lose, the dream of a home beyond most, the economy dependent on selling infrastructure and raw resources at bargain rates to generate illusions of wealth in acts of intergenerational piracy, corruption at all levels. If there were to be a treaty with the Australian government it could only ever be a treaty of their submission and dissolution of their house and constitution. After over two centuries of genocide we still remain and remember and by such stand above them by lore on every level, morally, legally and spiritually. The founding document of their federation is born in racism, rotten and illegal to the core. Their parliament doesn’t represent its people and I think the people see it, I think people don’t give themselves enough credit, this country is whatever we make it but that power only comes to those who realise it’s not about what we want, it’s about what needs to be done. We are prepared to tear things down and build something new together, no fear and no blood as equals. The first peoples of this land aren’t seeking saving; we are trying to show the people how to save the country.\n",

            "10635150500433722 CREDIT_CARD 41422 41439 Mycobacterium ulcerans causes a slowly progressing necrotizing infection of skin and soft tissue known as Buruli ulcer (BU) disease (1). In BU patients, early diagnosis followed by 8 weeks of treatment with a combined antibiotic regimen (rifampin and streptomycin-clarithromycin) is key to preventing complications that can arise from severe skin ulcerations (2). BU is a neglected tropical disease that can exceed the incidence of leprosy and tuberculosis in some areas of high endemicity (3). The disease has been reported in more than 30 countries worldwide; however, the biggest burden of disease is still found in impoverished rural areas of West and Central Africa (4), where 1,750 new cases were notified to the WHO in 2017 (5). BU epidemiology is characterized by its patchy focal distribution within countries were it is endemic (4). Disease foci are known to primarily occur around low-lying marshes, wetlands, and riverine areas (3). As living or working close to these slow-flowing or stagnant water bodies is a known risk factor for M. ulcerans infection (6), and as human-to-human transmission is very rare, it is generally believed that M. ulcerans is an environmental mycobacterium that can infect humans through introduction via microtraumata to the skin (7). However, the exact mode of disease transmission and the environmental reservoir(s) of M. ulcerans remain enigmatic in Africa (8), as culturing the slow-growing mycobacterium from nonclinical environmental sources has proved to be particularly challenging (9). This has severely hampered the ability of the BU community to establish the presence of viable M. ulcerans in potential environmental reservoirs. As M. ulcerans has the genome signature of a “niche-adapted” mycobacterium, it is considered unlikely to be found free living in various aquatic or terrestrial environments and is rather more likely living in close association with a host organism (10). We recently observed a temporal association between humans and the spread of BU across Africa during the period of neoimperialism (late 19th to early 20th century) (11). The introduction of both lineage Mu_A2 in the continent and lineage Mu_A1 in three well-sampled disease foci coincided closely with the instigation of colonial rule. Since these disease foci were inhabited prior to the arrival of the European powers and since introduction only occurred after colonization, we posited that displaced humans with actively infected openly discharging BU lesions inadvertently contaminated aquatic environments during water contact activities and thus spread the mycobacterium. Conventional genetic fingerprinting methods have largely failed to differentiate clinical disease isolates of M. ulcerans (12), leading to their replacement with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) (11, 13–16). The greater resolution offered by genomics to discriminate between isolates, combined with the availability of novel state-of-the-art demographic models in Bayesian phylogenetic analysis (17, 18), is opening up new possibilities to explore the pathogen’s cryptic epidemiology and disease ecology. A recent study in southeastern Australia (15) identified a striking relationship between the number of Victorian BU cases through time and the mycobacterial demographic history inferred from the genomic data. As such, modeling the demographic dynamics indicated the amount of BU cases was likely to be influenced by the abundance of the pathogen, providing an explanation for the apparent recent rise of Victorian cases. Likewise, a study on Mycobacterium tuberculosis used similar comparative genomics to investigate both the mycobacterial historical demography and the timeline of acquisition of antimicrobial resistance during a major outbreak of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in Buenos Aires, Argentina (19). The work indicated that a multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strain had been circulating for 15 years before its outbreak was detected. Furthermore, modeling of the past mycobacterial demography indicated a rapid increase in the mycobacterial population size in the early 1990s during a steep upsurge of HIV-related MDR-TB. The present study focuses on endemic BU foci in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and some of its neighboring countries. Prior to 2002, BU control in the Democratic Republic of the Congo suffered from decades of neglect and conflict, affecting the vast nation’s health and sanitation infrastructure (4). The first BU case of the Democratic Republic of the Congo was reported in 1950, in the Kwilu province (20). Since this first description, microbiologically confirmed cases have been identified in the provinces of Equateur, Haut-Uele, Ituri, Kwango, Kwilu, Kongo Central, Mai-Ndombe, and Maniema (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material) (21). The main focus of BU endemicity in the country is located in the Songololo territory of the Kongo Central province and encompasses the areas of high endemicity in the rural health zones of Kimpese and Nsona-Mpangu. The population of the territory (estimated at around 154,000 inhabitants) leads a sedentary lifestyle and lives mostly from subsistence agriculture and (petty) trade. Since no epidemiological studies were conducted in the territory until the 1960s and 1970s (22), it remained unclear whether BU was newly introduced or an old, undetected, and expanding illness in the region. In the aftermath of the Angolan civil war (1975 to 2002), BU was frequently diagnosed in Angolan refugees who lived in refugee camps located in the Songololo territory. As cases have been reported in Angola (23), the possibility has been put forward (24) that these patients were infected in Angola and reintroduced BU in the region. We believe a better understanding of the transmission and the disease dynamics of M. ulcerans infection could have a direct impact on the development of effective and appropriate control strategies against the disease. In this study, we sequenced and compared the genomes of 179 M. ulcerans strains isolated from patients in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, The Republic of the Congo (RC), and Angola over a 52-year period to investigate the microevolution and population dynamics of this pathogen during its establishment in this specific region. Genome sequence comparisons of 179 M. ulcerans isolates from Central Africa.To understand the dynamics and timing of the spread of M. ulcerans across Central Africa, we sequenced the genomes of 179 clinical isolates that were obtained between 1962 and 2014 and spanned most of the known areas of BU endemicity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, The Republic of the Congo, and Angola (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). To prevent mapping the obtained sequence reads to a reference that diverged significantly from these isolates, we assembled a new, complete closed DRC M. ulcerans reference chromosome using PacBio reads. This reference chromosome received the strain name SGL03 (for Songololo territory 2003). SGL03 comprises a single 5,625,184-bp (6,422 bp smaller than the Ghanaian reference chromosome Agy99) circular bacterial chromosome with a G+C content of 65.5%. Whole-genome comparisons between SGL03 and Agy99 revealed extensive synteny and collinearity. However, a total of 12 large (>100 bp) indels were identified between SGL03 and Agy99 (see Table S2). Most indel events were mediated by copies of insertion (IS) elements IS2404 and IS2606; these either flanked deletions or they were present in the deleted or substituted sequence stretches. Well represented in the deleted sequences were pseudogenes that either contained frameshift mutations or were disrupted by IS elements. Illumina sequence reads of the sample panel were aligned to the newly assembled SGL03 chromosome and, after removing any diversity detected in repetitive IS elements and ignoring small indel polymorphisms, we found 6,655 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) uniformly distributed along the bacterial chromosome, which amounts to 1 SNP per 846 bp (see Fig. S2). A total of 161 clones (unique genomes) were discerned among the isolate panel. A Bayesian time-measured phylogeny was inferred from a whole-genome alignment of the isolates (Fig. 1). Both known lineages of African M. ulcerans were identified within the Central African isolate panel: 178/179 (99.4%) corresponded to lineage Mu_A1 and 1/179 (0.6%) corresponded to the uncommon lineage Mu_A2. The average pairwise SNP difference (SNPΔ) between Mu_A1 Central African isolates was low (59 SNPs, standard deviation [SD] = 42), as the majority of the discovered diversity derived from the relatively large genetic distance (5,270 SNPs, SD = 7) between Mu_A1 and the single Mu_A2 isolate from the region. The Mu_A2 isolate (ITM130340) originated from a patient (female [F], 40 years old) from the hamlet Kilima in the Songololo territory (Nkamuna health area) (see Fig. S4). We were unable to retrospectively interview the patient to identify any travel history or activity that could explain the unexpected Mu_A2 distribution. Phylogenetic analysis reveals strong geographical restrictions on M. ulcerans dispersal at high-level geographical scales.Within an M. ulcerans phylogeny of the entire African continent (see Fig. S3), the single Songololo Mu_A2 isolate clustered together with a clade of 8 other Mu_A2 isolates originating from Benin, Gabon, and Cameroon. Furthermore, a distinct Mu_A1 isolate from The Republic of the Congo (ITM_071925) clustered together with a small clade of Nigerian and Cameroonian M. ulcerans isolates. More importantly, however, all other 177 Mu_A1 isolates of the Central African panel formed a monophyletic group within that continental African phylogeny. There was distinct spatial clustering of M. ulcerans from the different endemic BU foci within the phylogeny. For instance, all 123 isolates of the endemic BU focus of the Songololo territory formed a strongly supported monophyletic group (Fig. 2). The Songololo territory isolates had an average pairwise SNPΔ of 46 (SD = 18) and were unrelated to the four isolates from the neighboring Tshela territory (northwest in the Kongo Central province) that formed a separate monophyletic group (Fig. 2). We cannot identify a specific historic geographical route that these bacterial lineages followed, but the phylogenetic evidence clearly links these separate clonal expansions as a single epidemic. The clustering of M. ulcerans genotypes ends at fine geographical scales.We then explored the geographical distribution of M. ulcerans genotypes at a finer geographical scale: that of the Songololo territory. The 123 Songololo isolates originating from 123 individual patients were spread evenly over the territory, and the majority of health areas with a “modest” to “high” BU burden were well represented (Fig. S4). Bayesian model-based inference of the genetic population structure revealed the existence of six groups (designated BAPS groups 1 to 6) within the territory (Fig. 3). The six groups generally cooccurred, as in some regions of the territory, multiple groups were found to be circulating simultaneously. In the health area of Lovo for instance, up to five different groups were cocirculating (BAPS 1 to 5). The groups were, however, distributed differently over the study region: groups 2, 4, and 5 were found widely dispersed, while groups 1, 3, and 6 were more restricted (Fig. 3). Group 1 (n = 20) was found almost exclusively in the eastern Kimpese health area, while group 3 (n = 31) was localized in the western Nsona-Pangu health area (see Fig. S5). Group 6 was uncommon (n = 4) and found solely in the southwest. Within groups, there were some distinct subgroups, which very occasionally also had a limited distribution across the region. For example, one specific subgroup of BAPS group 2 consisted of seven isolates that all originated from a 90-km2 zone covering the neighboring health areas of Mukimbungu and Kasi (Fig. S5). However, other subgroups were far more broadly distributed, with the extreme example of identical genomes identified in different BU patients separated by larger distances (Fig. 3, I to X). A total of ten such genomes that were identified multiple times in the Songololo territory were discerned (Table 1). The average geographical distance between the domiciles of patients identified with isolates with identical genomes was 17.3 ± 18.1 km. The Central African mutation rate of M. ulcerans is similar to that inferred on a continental scale.We derived a timed phylogeny of Central African M. ulcerans while simultaneously inferring mutation rates and dates of divergence of key M. ulcerans clades (Fig. 1). In this process, a molecular clock was estimated using correlations between phylogenetic divergence and isolation times of heterochronous disease isolates. As a result, a mean genome wide substitution rate of 4.38E−8 per site per year (95% highest posterior density [HPD] interval, 2.83E−8 to 6.03E−8]) was demonstrated, which corresponds to an accumulation rate of 0.23 SNPs per bacterial chromosome per year (95% HPD interval, 0.15 to 0.32). The Bayesian phylogenetic analysis indicates that lineage Mu_A1 had been introduced in Central Africa multiple hundreds of years ago (tMCRA [Mu_A1], 1372; 95% HPD, 913 to 1776), while the timing of the BU introduction event in the Songololo territory was estimated at around 1865 (95% HPD, 1803 to 1915) (Fig. 1). Finally, the time tree also indicates that the separated “eastern” (tMCRA [BAPS-1], 1941; 95% HPD, 1908 to 1969) and “western” (tMCRA [BAPS-3], 1922; 95% HPD, 1885 to 1954) Songololo groups have most likely remained segregated over a timespan of half a century. Demographic history of M. ulcerans in the Songololo territory.The reconstruction of the demographic history of M. ulcerans in the Songololo territory involved the coestimation of its time tree, the mycobacterial population size at different points along the timescale of that phylogeny, and all other parameters of the employed model of molecular evolution. Consequently, the resulting plot of the population history includes credibility intervals that represent the combined phylogenetic and coalescent uncertainties. An inspection of the extended Bayesian skyline plot (EBSP) (Fig. 4) indicated that the M. ulcerans population size remained stable until the early 1980s, after which it increased slightly during the course of the 1990s, until it reached a peak around 2004. This was followed by a small decline that persisted until 2014. We identified temporal parallels between the observed past population dynamics of M. ulcerans from the Songololo territory and the timing of health policy changes managing the BU epidemic in that region (Fig. 4), though we need to recognize overlap in credibility intervals surrounding the estimates during these periods. We checked for factors that might bias the reconstruction of the mycobacterial population size over time by conducting extensive resampling and randomization experiments (see Fig. S6). The demographic history of a pathogen population leaves a “signature” in the genomes of modern representatives of that population (18). Reconstructing this history allows us to gain valuable insights into the processes that drove past population dynamics (25). We recognized temporal parallels between the mycobacterial population dynamics and the timing of health policy changes managing the BU epidemic in the Songololo territory (Fig. 4). The mycobacterial population size increased in the territory during a period of decreased attention to BU that resulted in the loss of specialized personnel. After the start of a national BU program and the implementation of free-of-charge treatment, a strong increase was noted in the number of admitted BU cases which concorded with a detected inflection—perhaps a small drop—of the mycobacterial population size. These observations suggest that control strategies at the public health level may have decreased the size of the human M. ulcerans reservoir and that this reservoir is important in sustaining new infections. This hypothesis predicts that even if other environmental reservoirs exist, the number of M. ulcerans infections will decrease if only human cases are treated. The M. ulcerans phylogeography revealed one almost exclusively predominant sublineage of Mu_A1 that arose in Central Africa and proliferated in the different foci of endemicity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, and The Republic of the Congo during the Age of Discovery (15th to 18th centuries). The principal sublineage of Mu_A1 was introduced into the Songololo territory around 1865 (95% HPD, 1803 to 1915), and over the subsequent century (1865 to 1974), it established itself and evolved in six distinct groups across the territory. This timing is consistent with in-depth interviews with former patients and observations of healed lesions that suggested that M. ulcerans infections already occurred in the Songololo territory in 1935 and probably even earlier (22). The genome-based time tree of Central African M. ulcerans thus revealed that the Songololo territory became an area of endemicity while the region was being colonized by Belgium (1880s). Early during the Belgian occupation, the Songololo territory was developed heavily to link the oceanic harbor of Matadi by rail with Kinshasa, where the Congo River becomes navigable, opening up the entire interior of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for economic exploitation (26). The Songololo territory was already inhabited long before the arrival of the European colonizers. The Kongo people are believed to have settled at the mouth of the Congo River before 500 BCE (before the Common Era), as part of the larger Bantu migration (27). However, our data reveal that it was only after the start of colonial rule that the epidemic Songololo M. ulcerans clone was introduced, possibly through the arrival of displaced BU-infected humans or as a consequence of the substantial environmental changes brought by the Belgian occupation of the Songololo territory. Similarly to recent studies that used comparative genomics to investigate the microevolution of M. ulcerans during its establishment in a continent (11) or region (13, 16), the genotypes in Central Africa show strong spatial segregation (Fig. 2). This was illustrated by the regional clustering of M. ulcerans from the different endemic BU foci (e.g., Songololo and Tshela) within the phylogenies. This clustering of cases within foci of endemicity reflects a common source of infection within the disease focus. These repeated findings indicate that when M. ulcerans is introduced in a particular area, it remains isolated, resulting in a localized clonal expansion associated with that area. An inspection of the time tree showed that a clonal complex associated with a focus of endemicity often has been pervasive in that region for a considerable time; in the case of Songololo, for around 150 years. Even within the Songololo territory, we observed that the separated eastern Kimpese health area (tMCRA [BAPS-1], 1941) and western Nsona-Pangu health area (tMCRA [BAPS-2], 1922) groups have most likely remained segregated over a timespan of half a century, indicating that M. ulcerans spreads relatively slowly between neighboring regions. This also indicates that environmental reservoirs of the mycobacterium in that region had to remain localized and relatively isolated. Unlike the larger geographic scale data, at smaller geographical scales, genotypes start to co-occur. First, four Songololo BAPS groups were found to be cocirculating. Moreover, we observed completely identical genomes originating from patients living in villages separated by distances of on average 17 km, similar to the findings of recent studies (13, 14). We believe the observed “breakup” of the focal distribution pattern at smaller geographical scales can be explained by the determined low substitution rate that corresponds to the accumulation of just 0.23 SNPs per bacterial chromosome per year. The slow substitution rate severely limits the accumulation of point mutations and as such, lowers the resolving power of the genomes. This explains why (in the most extreme case), over a period of 5 years, identical genomes were discovered in three patients who lived in three different villages separated by 26 km: insufficient time has elapsed for point mutations to accumulate. Finally, an old debate relating to the role of Angolan refugees on a resurge of BU in the Songololo territory (24) can be settled. As most of these refugees had already lived in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for several years before their diagnosis, and as some young Angolan BU patients were even born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo without even having visited Angola, an introduction from Angola was already believed to be unlikely. Now, an analysis of our phylogenies shows that no typical Angolan genotypes were detected in Songololo, indicating that the refugees were in all likelihood infected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In conclusion, in the present study, we used both temporal associations and the study of the mycobacterial demographic history in a focus of endemicity to implicate human-induced changes and activities over (recent) historical scales behind the spread of BU in Central Africa. We propose that patients with infected discharging BU lesions can contaminate slow-flowing riparian and lentic environments through activities involving water contact and that these patients can constitute an important means of bacterial spread. A total of 74% of BU patients identified during a cross-sectional study (28) of the Songololo territory had ulcerative lesions (49% category I, 31% category II, and 20% category III), indicating that a high percentage of patients might be shedding bacteria into the environment and potentially indirectly infecting others. We suggest that in BU-affected areas, chains of transmission can be broken and the spread of disease stopped through improved disease surveillance, resulting in treatment during the preulcerative onset of the infection. This view is supported by the decline of BU incidence recorded in some regions of endemicity which profited from such enhanced active surveillance practices (29). Study sites.The study covered all BU foci in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, The Republic of the Congo, and Angola that have ever yielded positive M. ulcerans cultures. The foci of endemicity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are located in the provinces of Kwango, Kongo Central (previously known as Bas-Congo), and Maniema (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The vast majority of isolates originated from the Songololo territory of the Kongo Central province. Isolates from the area of low endemicity of Tshela territory, northwest in the Kongo Central province, were also included. Isolates from the Maniema province originated from the historical BU focus of the Kasongo territory (30), which was recently assessed as still active (31). Finally, the province of Kwango was represented by a recently discovered focus of endemicity along the Kwango River, a tributary of the Congo River that forms the border between Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (32) (Fig. S1). Bacterial isolates.We analyzed a panel of 179 M. ulcerans strains originating from disease foci in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, The Republic of the Congo, and Angola that had been isolated between 1962 and 2014 (Table S1). As 13 isolates of this panel had no geographical information linked to them, they were included in the molecular dating work but omitted from the phylogeographical analysis. Even though the exact geographical origin of these 13 isolates was not established, we know they originated from the same hospitals as the other isolates of the panel. Based on conventional phenotypic and genotypic methods, all bacterial isolates had previously been assigned to the species M. ulcerans (33). Mycobacterial isolates were maintained for prolonged storage at ≤−70°C in Dubos broth enriched with oleic acid-albumin-dextrose (OAD) growth supplement and glycerol. In addition to the isolates sequenced here, 144 other African genomes (described in reference 11) were included to provide appropriate genetic context for interpreting the diversity and evolution of Central African M. ulcerans. Permission for the study was obtained from the ITM institutional review board (Belgium) and the ethics committee of the Public Health School of the University of Kinshasa (the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Sequencing.Index-tagged paired-end sequencing-ready libraries were prepared from genomic DNA (gDNA) extracts with the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit. Genome sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer according to the manufacturers’ protocols, with 100-bp or 150-bp paired-end sequencing chemistry. Sequencing statistics are provided in Table S1. The quality of raw Illumina reads was investigated with FastQC v0.11.3 (34). Prior to further analysis, reads were cleaned with clip, a tool in the Python utility toolset Nesoni v0.130 (35). Reads were filtered to remove those containing ambiguous base calls, any reads <50 nucleotides in length, and reads containing only homopolymers. All reads were further trimmed to remove residual ligated Nextera adaptors and low-quality bases (<Q10) at the 3′ end. The average read lengths of read pairs after clipping are summarized for all isolates in Table S1. A new, complete closed DRC M. ulcerans reference chromosome was assembled using PacBio reads. Isolate ITM032481 originated from a well-documented patient (male, 10 years old) from the hamlet Nkondo-Kiombia (Minkelo health area) (Fig. S4) who presented with a severe disseminated form of BU in 2003. BU was confirmed in the patient with all four diagnostic tests: Ziehl-Neelsen microscopy, IS2404 qPCR, culture, and histopathology. Intact, pure high-molecular-weight gDNA was obtained from the isolate by harvesting the growth of 10 Löwenstein-Jensen (LJ) slants followed by heat inactivation (80°C for 1 h), enzymatic digestion (proteinase K, lysozyme, and RNase), and purification with the Genomic DNA buffer set (Qiagen, catalog number 19060) and 100/G Genomic-tips (Qiagen, catalog number 10243). This gDNA sample was submitted to the Duke Sequencing and Genomic Technologies Shared Resource for sequencing on a Pacific Biosciences RSII instrument. Libraries of 15 to 20 kb were constructed and sequenced on 3 SMRT cells using P5-C3 chemistry. This yielded 895 Mbp from a total of 161,629 subreads. The average subread length was 5,536 bp with a sequencing depth of 160×. Data were analyzed using SMRT Analysis v2.3.0 (Pacific Biosciences). The continuous long reads (CLR) were assembled de novo using the PacBio Hierarchical Genome Assembly Process 3 (HGAP.3) and polished using Quiver as previously described (36). This resulted in a single contig that was polished a final time with paired-end Illumina reads. The final contig was subsequently circularized and annotated using Prokka v1.11 (37). The annotated closed genome was then manually curated and visualized using both Artemis v.16 (38) and Geneious v9.0.5 (39). The Congolese M. ulcerans Mu_ITM032481 bacterial reference chromosome sequence received the strain name SGL03. Read mapping and SNP detection.Read mapping and SNP detection were performed using the Snippy v3.0 pipeline (40). The Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) v0.7.12 (41) was used with default parameters to map clipped read pairs to the new Congolese SGL03 reference genome. Due to the unreliability of read mapping in mobile repetitive regions, all ISE elements (IS2404 and IS2606) were hard masked in these reference genomes (0.398 Mb/5.625 Mb, i.e., 7% of SGL03). After read mapping to M. ulcerans SGL03, average read depths were determined with SAMtools v1.2 (42) and are summarized for all isolates in Table S1. SNPs were subsequently identified using the variant caller FreeBayes v0.9.21 (43), with a minimum depth of 10 and a minimum variant allele proportion of 0.9. Snippy was used to pool all identified SNP positions called in at least one isolate and interrogate all isolates of the panel at that position. As such, a multiple sequence alignment of core SNPs was generated. Phylogeographic analysis.Bayesian model-based inference of the genetic population structure was performed using the Clustering with linked loci module (44) in BAPS v.6.0 (45). The optimal number of genetically diverged BAPS groups (K) was estimated in our data by running the estimation algorithm with the prior upper bound of K in the range of 1 to 20. Since the algorithm is stochastic, the analysis was run in 20 replicates for each value of K to increase the probability of finding the posterior optimal clustering with that specific value of K. On the assumption that patients were infected near their residences, the latitude and longitude coordinates of a location in the vicinity of patients’ residences at the time of the first clinical visit were collected, including for retrospective isolates, by using handheld global positioning system (GPS) devices (Garmin eTrex 20). When exact residence locations were missing, we used the latitude and longitude of the village center. QGIS v.2.14.1 (46) was used to generate the figures of the geographical distribution of Congolese M. ulcerans. The QGIS Python plugin Points displacement was used to modify point shape files, where point features with the same position overlapped. Point displacement rendered such features in a circle around the original “real” position. Geographical analysis of diversity and the overlaying of a phylogenetic tree were performed with GenGIS v2.5.0 (47), based on the household GPS coordinates of patients and whole-genome maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies of the corresponding M. ulcerans isolates. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis.Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies were estimated ten times from SNP alignments using RAxML v8.2.4 (48) under a plain generalized time reversible (GTR) model (no rate heterogeneity) with likelihood calculation correction for ascertainment bias using the Stamatakis method (49). Identical sequences were removed before the RAxML runs. For each run, we performed 10,000 rapid bootstrap analyses to assess support for the ML phylogeny. The tree with the highest likelihood across the ten runs was selected. We used TreeCollapseCL v4 (50) to collapse nodes in the tree with bootstrap values below a set threshold of 70% to polytomies while preserving the length of the tree. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis.We used BEAST2 v2.4.4 (51) to date evolutionary events, determine the substitution rate, estimate the demographic history, and produce a time tree of M. ulcerans from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We used Path Sampling (52) as implemented in reference 11 to compare the performance of two competing coalescent demographic methods: constant size (parametric) and the extended Bayesian skyline plot (EBSP; nonparametric). The model with the EBSP tree prior had the highest marginal likelihood (Bayes factor [BF] = 10.36). An uncorrelated log-normal relaxed molecular clock (53) was used with the EBSP demographic method and bModelTest (54) to infer a genome scale Congolese M. ulcerans time tree and with tip dates defined as the year of isolation (Table S1). BEAUti xmls were manually modified to specify the number of invariant sites in the genome. Analysis was performed in BEAST2 using a total of 5 independent chains of 800 million generations, with samples taken every 80,000 Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) generations. Log files were inspected in Tracer v1.6 (55) for convergence and proper mixing and to see whether the chain length produced an effective sample size (ESS) for all parameters larger than 300, indicating sufficient sampling. LogCombiner v2.4.0 (51) was then used to combine log and tree files of the independent BEAST2 runs, after having removed a 30% burn-in from each run. Thus, parameter medians and 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals were estimated from 35,000 sampled MCMC generations. The analysis was also replicated on ten random subsets of 100 taxa of the complete taxon set to test if our results were affected by sampling bias. To ensure the prior parameters were not overconstraining the calculations, the entire analysis was also run while sampling only from the prior, and the resulting parameter distributions were compared in Tracer. TreeAnnotator v2.4.0 (51) was used to summarize the posterior sample of time trees in order to produce a maximum clade credibility tree with the posterior estimates of node heights visualized on it. When using the EBSP tree prior, the mycobacterial population history is coestimated with the time tree in a single analysis. Briefly, the approach reconstructs the demographic history by taking advantage of the relationship between the population size (N) and the length of coalescent intervals (ɣ) in the estimated time-tree: Ni = ɣi i(i − 1)/2, where i representing the number of lineages in a particular coalescent interval (18). The result is a piecewise reconstruction of the mycobacterial population history along the time tree. The estimated timing of population increases and decreases is dependent on the estimated substitution rate. A potential source of error when estimating the substitution rate is that tip dates alone, rather than the link of tip dates associated with sequence data, might be driving the results, especially when the sequence data lack temporal phylogenetic information (56). Therefore, a permutation test was used to assess the validity of the temporal signal in the data. This was undertaken by performing 20 additional BEAST2 runs (of 800 million MCMC generations each) with identical substitutions (bModelTest), clocks (uncorrelated log-normal relaxed), and demographic models (EBSP) but with tip dates randomly reshuffled to sequences (57). This reshuffled “null set” of tip date and sequence correlations was then compared with the substitution rate estimate of the genuine tip date and sequence correlation.

(2) The socionomic hypothesis: Social mood is a natural product of human interaction and is patterned according to the Wave Principle. Its trends and extent determine the character of social action, including the economic, political and cultural. The contrast between these two positions comes down to this: The standard presumption is that in the social setting, events govern mood; the socionomic hypothesis recognizes that mood governs events. In both cases, the stock market is seen as an efficient mechanism. In the first instance, it presumably revalues stocks continually and rationally in reaction to events; in the second, it revalues stocks continually and impulsively as the independent social mood changes. We will now investigate five presumed “outside forces” to see which of these views their relationship to the stock market supports. The Economy The standard presumption is that the state of the economy is a key determinant of the stock market’s trends. All day long on financial television and year after year in financial print media, investors debate the state of the economy for clues to the future course of the stock market. If this presumed causal relationship actually existed, then there would be some evidence that the economy leads the stock market. On the contrary, for decades, the Commerce Department of the federal government has identified the stock market as a leading indicator of the economy, which is indeed the case. If the standard presumption were true, then changes in the economy would coincide with or precede trend changes in aggregate stock prices. However, a study of Figure 1 will show that changes in the economy coincide with or follow trend changes in aggregate stock prices. Except for the timing of the recession of 1946 (which supports neither case), all economic contractions came upon or after a downturn in aggregate stock prices, and all economic recoveries came upon or after an upturn in aggregate stock prices.1 In not one case did a contraction or recovery precede a change in aggregate stock prices, which would repeatedly be the case if investors in fact reacted to economic trends and events. This chronology persists back into the nineteenth century as far as the data goes. The socionomic hypothesis explains the data. Changes in the stock market immediately reflect the changes in endogenous social mood. As social mood becomes increasingly positive, productive activity increases; as social mood becomes increasingly negative, productive activity decreases. These results show up in lagging economic statistics as expansions and recessions. The standard presumption has no explanation for the relative timing of these two phenomena. 1986-1991 a (A) (C) Inflation-Adjusted DJIA. it will be good/bad for the market. the stock market’s trend was up.3 The socionomic conclusion is this: When social mood waxes positive.

Prechter 1930 1940 1950 1960 Figure 1 1970 1980 1990 2000 Politics The standard presumption is that political trends are a key determinant of the stock market’s trends. then there would be evidence that a change in power from one party’s leader to another affects the stock market.2 In not one case did an incumbent win re-election despite a deeply falling stock market or lose in a landslide despite a strongly rising stock market. commentators debate the effect that its outcome will have on stock prices. “If so-and-so gets elected. In all cases where an incumbent was rejected by a landslide.” we often hear. Examine Figure 2 and observe that strong and persistent trends in the stock market determine whether an incumbent president will be re-elected in a landslide or defeated in one. In all cases where an incumbent remained in office in a landslide. on the other hand. can show the opposite causality at work.

There was an issue with the microphone of the device and I took it to the Nokia Care center at Link Africa, Accra.

It was utterly surprising that a Nokia Center refused to repair a Nokia mobile under warranty.

Video footage of factory farms can be a valuable tool for animal advocates but often ag-gag laws criminalize such videos.

Presented by Pamela Frasch, assistant dean, Animal Law Program Lewis & Clark; and Joyce Tischler, founder and general counsel, Animal Legal Defense Fund.

Unfortunately, a lot of Oregonians get a quick education if they are arrested for a crime or are involved in a civil suit. So often, you peel open your ballot and look at the various races. You come across a couple of candidates running for the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court and your reaction is \"Who are these people?\" I know I have and I usually end up not voting for either. This time, I decided to do a little research on these two candidates to help me decide.Let me give you my opinion on this race. Of course, you decide which candidate receives your vote. Blumnenaur. I know the history of Blumnenauer since I lived in Portland for 24 years while he was on the Portland City Council and US Congressman. I feel strongly about Blumenauer. I would not vote for my own mother if she was endorsed by Blumenauer. Volpert is supported by the Oregon Education Association(OEA), the State Teachers Union and received $1500 from them. Judge candidates are not permitted to advertise their legal philosophy or how they will rule on any particular case. Thus, it is hard to figure out who to support. However, In my mind, do we need to put another judge on the Court Appeals supported by the Liberal Portland Crowd? I think not and I am voting for James C.Egan. 21st century best practices recommended by the ICMA (International City/County Management Association. ICMA www.icma.org.

I am voting for the Home Rule Charter “Voice of the Voters” measure 6-143 Section 9.4 stops this. to decide elections. Who are these voters? What are their beliefs, affiliations and loyalties? The Libertarian Vote: Swing Voters, Tea Parties, and the Fiscally Conservative, Socially Liberal Center reveals that 10 to 20 percent of Americans are fiscally conservative and socially liberal—libertarian. And over the past decade, unlike loyal Democrats and Republicans, they have been swing voters. They have contributed, for example, to the success of both the tea party and the gay marriage movement. The Libertarian Vote provides some of the most pertinent and authoritative insights available on this substantial block of voters. As the book demonstrates, the strength of libertarian voters, and their increasingly decisive role at the center of a divided electorate, remain underestimated and only superficially understood by many candidates and journalists. Candidates and political strategists willing to look more carefully at them may very well discover a large group of voters energetically looking for a home. Rob, here are a few links. This should keep you busy a short time. am voting for because of the strategic political expediency of the decision. On the local ballot in Bandon, the citizens will be making choices for Mayor, three city councilors, a new taxing district, and the members of the board for that new district. surrounding area. Mr. Claassen is an enemy of the taxpayer and he should retire from local politics when his term is up on the city council. his sense of practicality. It would also be good to have a fresh perspective. However, I will be voting “NO” on Measure 6-146. This measure is the proposed formation of the Bandon Community Swimming Pool Recreation District. A pool is a luxury and now is not the time to raise local taxes. let us stop creating more debt and vote against the Bandon Pool District. Vote NONE OF THE ABOVE or NOTA for ALL the candidates running for the position of board member of the new Bandon Community Swimming Pool Recreation District. Commissioner Robert “Bob” Main will be receiving my vote and has my endorsement for County Commissioner Position #1. His opponent, Commissioner Fred Messerle, voted in favor of increasing the maximum indebtedness of the Bandon Urban Renewal Area #1 at a cost to the county of about $30,000 annually until the year 2033. In addition, Messerle has been in favor of the Administrator position from the beginning. Given the opportunity, he would have enacted the administrator ordinance without going to a public vote. He is also deeply involved with the Winter Lake Project and too closely related to the South Coast Development Council. John Sweet will be receiving my vote for County Commissioner Position #2. Tribe as their attorney makes her a liability for the county. Any of her decisions on the O&C lands, as a sitting commissioner, would be a conflict of interest going beyond just perception. Her support of the County Administrator position is a risk to our representative form of government. Dan Pierce will receive my vote and has my endorsement for Director in Zone #2. Charlie Waterman will receive my vote and has my endorsement for Director in Zone #3. I will write-in my own name for Director in Zone #4, because there is no candidate filed in that position and I want another choice. Please feel free to write-in my name. Write-in your own name or write-in someone with integrity for any position that has no candidate running in the race. It is the American way to make up our own choices. Wayne Krieger will receive my vote for State Rep in the Congressional District #1. James L Buchal will receive my vote for Attorney General. Tom Cox will receive my vote and has my endorsement for State Treasurer. He once ran for Governor as a Libertarian candidate and is currently running as a registered Republican. His experience and knowledge of the financial markets will help him in the position of treasurer. Knute Buehler will receive my vote for Secretary of State. It is time for a change. Libertarian candidate, Chuck Huntting, will receive my vote for representative in the 4th District of the US Congress. My choice for president should not reflect the image of the disgruntled voter. In fact, this is a very happy vote for me. I have the great opportunity to vote for my former Governor, Gary Johnson, Libertarian candidate for President of the United States. I will vote for Governor Gary Johnson for President. I was on the committee to elect Johnson for President in 1999 and consider myself ahead of the times. Former Governor Johnson is the right person for the job of Commander-In-Chief. He has experience as Chief Executive in business and politics and was incredible successful in both positions. Obama is a big government socialist with plans to continue to change and reform the fundamental structure of our government. Romney has the same record of increasing the size of government and his foreign policy is identical to the current president. I cannot bring myself to vote for neither the Republican nor the Democrat. Both parties have devalued what it means to be an American, figuratively and literally. It is not a wasted vote to vote for someone of principle and it will force the Republicans to work towards the goal of a limited government or face the consequences of defeat. people and the representatives on the Board of Commissioners. The charter will restrain the growth of authority and allows the voter to retain a representative form of government. I will Vote “NO” on measure 6-144. This is The Ordinance to change the Board of Commissioners and create a County Administrator position or County Czar. Creating a new position will further bloat our local county government and only benefit government developers, to the detriment of the taxpayer. It will increase administrative costs to the county, while eroding representation. I will Vote “NO” on measure 77. This Ballot measure is a constitutional revision relating to state governmental responses to catastrophic disasters. The law is vague and it broadens the scope and power of the Governor. I will Vote “YES” on Measure 78. This measure changes constitutional language describing governmental system of separation of powers and it corrects grammatical and spelling changes. It would be good to have a grammatically correct constitution. I will Vote “YES” on Measure 79. This measure will amend the state constitution and prohibits real estate transfer taxes, fees, other assessments, except those operative on December 31, 2009. This is a double tax on property that discourages businesses from moving to Oregon. I will Vote “YES” on Measure 80. This measure allows personal marijuana, hemp cultivation/use without license and creates a commission to regulate commercial marijuana cultivation/sale. This is a badly written law, but it moves the mark forward towards legalizing marijuana for adults. The cannabis sativa plant is legal for all consenting adults would have been the proper way to write this law. Legislation that simple would be immensely more conducive to our constitutional values than our current situation where there is a War on Drugs. I will Vote “NO” on Measure 81. This measure prohibits commercial non-tribal fishing with gillnets in Oregon “inland waters,” and allows the use of seine nets. This law will destroy more jobs in our state. It does nothing to stop others from performing the same practice of gillnet fishing. I will Vote “NO” on Measure 82. This measure amends the Oregon constitution to permit the establishment of privately owned casinos and mandates a percentage of revenues payable to a dedicated state fund. Sounds good, but it does not allow the construction of private casinos within a 60-mile radius of existing tribal casinos operating on reservation land, which would eliminate 95% of the state. A market that restricted is not free market competition. Moreover, this measure is directed toward one particular casino, which will unfortunately be constructed using government development funding---i.e. ---our tax dollars. I will Vote “NO” on Measure 83. This measure authorizes a privately owned casino, The Wood Village. It would mandate Wood Village to pay a percentage of their revenue to a dedicated state fund. The state is desperately looking for new revenue streams, so they are willing to sell out the competition in the free market just for a few cents on the dollar. A better measure would make the ownership of private casinos in the state of Oregon legal. I will Vote “YES” on Measure 84. This law would phase out existing inheritance taxes on large estates, and all taxes on intra-family property transfers. One of Oregon’s largest exports is its children and young families. our state to put such a burden on families. education K through 12. This is a backdoor tax increase, or otherwise it would be returned to the taxpayer. The school districts already receive the largest piece of the property tax pie. Then these districts turn around and give that money away to private developers through the tax increment financing process of Urban Renewal. What a joke and an insult to taxpayers. We need a revolutionary change for these school boards and we have to stop tax increases. The conversations will be about identifying Libertarian solutions to the problems faced by America and the importance of building the Libertarian Party into a major political party. http://www.facebook.com/events/165112913612960 The event will also be streamed live over the internet visit www.DoubleTheLP.com on Friday for a link to the broadcast.

Polls show that the sentiment across the country is a desire for a real change in politics and that more Americans demand a third party option than ever before.

In 1994, he inherited a state government on the wrong end of every statistic. Within two terms, he had eliminated New Mexico's budget deficit and cut the rate of state government growth in half while reducing the state workforce by over 10% (without laying off a single qualified state worker). While in office, Gary Johnson vetoed 750 bills of wasteful legislation and had thousands of line item vetoes – earning him the nickname, “Governor Veto.” Gary Johnson didn’t just talk about efficient, limited government, he ran one. An avid skier, adventurer, and bicyclist, he has reached the highest peak on four of the seven continents, including Mt. Everest. For more information, please visit www.GaryJohnson2012.com.

Send the e-mail to gemeente@eindhoven.nl. Give your name, your address and attach proof of payment of the City Pass. My City Pass isn't working. What should I do? If your City Pass isn't working for one of the products you have loaded, get in touch with the supplier (Ir. Ottenbad, Tongelreep, Stadsparkeren, Lock 'n Go or Cure). They will be able to solve the problem, generally by reactivating your pass for that particular product. If, after that, your pass still doesn't work, it's probably defect. In that case, apply for a new one.\n",

            "FR76 3000 3008 1300 0511 2892 577 IBAN_CODE 1371 1404 An Internet TV channel of (pro-)Russian extremists has published a video featuring four Frenchmen who came to Donetsk in Eastern Ukraine to fight against Ukrainian forces. They do not say their names and think that France will not know of their participation in the terrorist activities in Ukraine. Now it's time to reveal some of their secrets. This video and other evidence I have gathered suggest that Guillaume \"Lenormand\" Cuvelier, Nikola Perovic and Mickael Takahashi first came to Moscow in the second half of June where they met Russian citizen Mikhail Polynkov.* The latter is engaged in assisting international extremists to get to Eastern Ukraine. From Moscow, Cuvelier, Perovic and Takahashi went to Rostov-on-Don. There they were trained for two weeks and then sent to the Ukrainian city of Donetsk which is currently under the terrorist control. Either in Rostov-on-Don or already in Donetsk, they met another Frenchman: Victor-Alfonso Lenta. Guillaume \"Lenormand\" Cuvelier (b. 9 April 1988) is coming from Normandy where he has been participating in various ultranationalist movements for ten years: Jeunesses identitaires (Young Identitarians), Parti de la France (Party of France, PDF), and Troisième voie (Third Way). In 2010, he was PDF's candidate in the Eure department. \"Lenormand\" is his pseudonym. His bank account is with Société Générale (IBAN: FR76 3000 3008 1300 0511 2892 577, SWIFT: SOGEFRPP) through which the whole group of the French right-wing extremists is funded. Victor-Alfonso Lenta (b. 1989?) is coming from Toulouse. He is a former corporal of the 3rd Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment, and served in Afghanistan, Chad, Ivory Coast and Gabon. He is said to have been kicked out from the army for his involvement in a neo-Nazi group. On his return to Toulouse, he actively participated in the Jeunesses identitaires. Nikola Perovic (b. 1989?) has dual French/Serbian citizenship and apparently lives in Belgrade. He is a former corporal of the 13th Battalion of the Chasseurs Alpins and served in Afghanistan. Michael Takahashi (b. 13 October 1987) is coming from Paris. He is an ardent supporter of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and has been cooperating with various ultranationalist groups in France and Serbia. So, what are these Frenchmen doing in Eastern Ukraine? All four are extreme right activists who are influenced, especially Cuvelier and Lenta, by the ideas of the European New Right. The four Frenchmen have founded a group called \"Unité Continentale\" (Continental Unity), and its manifesto provides further insights into the ideology they share. They believe that the French government is \"a puppet of Brussels\" and that NATO is \"a terrorist military alliance that uses French army to serve the interests of banks\". The EU, in their view, denies France's national sovereignty, while France itself is \"a slave of the American Empire that dictates the country's foreign policy and directly interferes in the domestic policy\". The solution of the alleged problem, according to the Unité Continentale, is Neo-Eurasianism, an ideology elaborated by Russian fascist Aleksandr Dugin, which they call \"Continentalism\". It rejects globalisation and liberalism, as well as advocating the destruction of the EU. Instead, they promote \"cooperation between the major nation-states of Europe and their respective areas of influence\". Russia would play an important role in this cooperation and, especially, in their fight against \"Anglo-Saxon globalism, Atlanticism and the decadent West\". The Unité Continentale's ideologues do not see the conflict in Eastern Ukraine as Russia's long-planned war on Ukraine. Rather, they think that the US and the EU have attacked Eastern Ukraine. Therefore, by killing Ukrainians, the Unité Continentale is waging a war on the US and EU. In an interview to one Russian website, Cuvelier says that he believes that the West has started the Third World War in Lybia and Syria and it has now spread to Ukraine. Russia, in its turn, has challenged \"the international globalism\", and the Unité Continentale is happy to assist Russian forces and its proxies in Eastern Ukraine in murdering Ukrainian people. They call it \"Eurasian solidarity\". * - The previous version of this post erroneously claimed that Hungarian right-wing extremist Ferenc Almássy had also visited Moscow and met with the fighters and Mikhail Polynkov. However, there has been no further evidence that Almássy was indeed in Moscow. At the same time, he seems to have interviewed Cuvelier and Takahashi in Budapest in 2015 for TV Liberté. We remember french collaboration with nazists. France even provide mistral to terrorussia when she kills ukrainian people!!! Actually, they seem to be dragging their feet on turn the Mistral over. The French Underground was one of the things that knocked the Nazis down hard. Lots of extremely brave Frenchmen took on suicide missions to get rid of the Nazi plague. Thank you for the info!

His life depended on the operation of the skull, where bones have grown together, as his brain otherwise couldn’t have fully developed. Another such operation was the one where they have implanted a drainage tube which drains extra liquor from his brain to the stomach area. Tim enjoys making pancakes at various events.

            "9780814719541 US_BANK_NUMBER 14953 14966 Not to be confused with New York City Department of Transportation. The New York City Board of Transportation or the Board of Transportation of the City of New York (NYCBOT or BOT) was a city transit commission and operator in New York City, consisting of three members appointed by the mayor. It was created in 1924 to control city-owned and operated public transportation service within the New York City Transit System. The agency oversaw the construction and operation of the municipal Independent Subway System (IND), which was constructed shortly after the Board was chartered. The BOT later presided over the major transfers of public transit from private control to municipal control that took place in the 1940s, including the unification of the New York City Subway in 1940. In 1953, the Board was dissolved and replaced by the state-operated New York City Transit Authority, now part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). In 1874, the New York State Legislature passed a bill allowing for the creation of a rapid transit commission in New York City, which was formed in 1875. This commission mapped out elevated railway routes that would be built by private companies, but did not plan any underground lines. In 1889, Mayor Hugh J. Grant created a five-member rapid transit board to lay out lines in the city. In 1891, the State Legislature passed the Rapid Transit Act, allowing the government of New York City and all cities with a population of over one million to create a board of \"rapid transit railroad commissioners\", which would dictate the expansion of rapid transit facilities within the city. The government could issue bonds in order to fund rapid transit for the city. That year, a five-member rapid transit board was created for the city, called the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners. The board received bids for a municipal underground rail line, but no bids were selected. The board was abolished in 1894 by the State Legislature due to its failure to create a subway line. It was replaced by a new board whose members included the Mayor of New York City. That year, the New York City government issued a referendum stating that future rapid transit lines should be municipally operated, as opposed to issuing franchises to private operators. In spite of this, the initial subway lines to be operated in the city − the \"first subway\" opened in 1904, and the initial portion of the Centre Street Loop to Essex Street opened in 1908 − were privately operated by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) respectively. The initial 1890s transit board was replaced in 1907 by the state-run New York Public Service Commission (PSC). This agency would oversee the Dual Contracts subway expansion, which led to the construction of new lines for the IRT and BRT. Until 1924, municipal public transportation actions originated primarily from state-controlled agencies, including the 1891 and 1894 rapid transit boards, the PSC, and most recently the New York State Transit Commission which was created in March 1921. Following the creating of the State Transit Commission and the reelection of Al Smith as Governor of New York in 1922, then-mayor John Francis Hylan and future mayors Jimmy Walker (then a state senator) and John P. O'Brien (the city's corporation counsel) sought to establish a city-controlled transit commission. Hylan had been both an opponent of private transit operation, particularly that of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT; the successor to the BRT), and a political opponent of Smith. Hylan also had his own plans for a city-operated subway system. In 1924, the New York City Board of Transportation was created by the New York City Board of Estimate following a bill passed by New York State Legislature. The Board of Transportation would responsible for mapping and constructing new rapid transit lines, carrying out the powers dictated in the 1891 Rapid Transit Act, while the State Transit Commission would continue to oversee the privately operated systems. The bill had been deadlocked in the State Assembly for two years until a compromise bill was introduced in February 1924 and passed on April 11 of that year. Governor Smith signed the bill into law on May 2, and the BOT assumed power on June 1. The board's first chairman was John Hanlon Delaney, one of Hylan's top advisers who had been the transit construction commissioner since 1919. The BOT would release the initial plans for what would become the Independent Subway System (IND) on December 9, 1924, based largely off of Mayor Hylan's plans. The first IND subway line and the system's trunk line, the IND Eighth Avenue Line, broke ground on March 14, 1925, and was opened on September 10, 1932. On August 29, 1929, the BOT released its first major plans for the expansion of the city-owned system still under construction. A revision of this proposal was released almost ten years later on July 5, 1939. These plans would later be called the IND Second System, and would go largely unbuilt due to the Great Depression and World War II. Beginning on June 1, 1940 under the mayoral administration of Fiorello H. La Guardia, the Board of Transportation took over the assets of the IRT and BMT for municipal operations in an event referred to as unification. The event placed the three rapid transit systems − IRT, BMT, IND − under a single operator. The BOT also inherited the BMT's extensive surface transit network in Brooklyn and Queens, which consisted primarily of streetcar lines along with a few electric trolley coach and diesel-powered bus routes. The BOT proceeded to close the IRT-operated Second and Ninth Avenue elevated lines in Manhattan, and the BMT-operated Third and Fifth Avenue elevateds in Brooklyn. On December 15, 1940, the IND's second Manhattan trunk line − the IND Sixth Avenue Line − was completed. In 1941, the BOT began motorizing the former BMT streetcar lines in Brooklyn and Queens into diesel bus routes or trolley coach routes. The further motorization of surface lines, and the completion of the IND system, however, was delayed due to World War II. Unification made the Board of Transportation the largest public transit operator in North America, in addition to being one of the few systems under public ownership at the time. Following the end of World War II, the BOT resumed subway construction. On February 23, 1947, the Board of Transportation assumed the bus routes of Isle Transportation in Staten Island. On March 30, 1947, the BOT took over the North Shore Bus Company in Queens. Both companies could not operate on the mandated five-cent fare and went bankrupt. This gave the city control of the majority of surface transit in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. It also created three distinct surface transit divisions: the Brooklyn Bus and Trolley Division, the Staten Island Bus Division, and the Queens Bus Division. On September 24, 1948, the BOT took over the East Side Omnibus Corporation and Comprehensive Omnibus Corporation in Manhattan. At this time, the BOT resumed motorizing trolley lines, and proceeded to construct new storage and repair facilities. It also purchased new buses, to either replace streetcars or the dilapidated buses inherited from private operators. A GM \"old-look\" transit bus bearing the original green and white color scheme of the Board of Transportation, and a white circular BOT logo. The color scheme would be inherited by the Transit Authority. Following an artificial operating surplus during World War II, brought on by gas and rubber rations leading to increased mass transit usage, the Board of Transportation had its first operational deficit in 1947, amounting to $18 million. On March 30, 1948, Governor Thomas E. Dewey signed legislation to allow the BOT to increase fares with the approval of the New York City mayor. On July 1, 1948, the Board of Transportation raised the fare for its rapid transit system from five cents to ten cents, with the approval of Mayor William O'Dwyer. The nickel fare had been in place in the subway system since October 27, 1904, a period of 45 years, and was one of the main provisions of the Dual Contracts. New York City was the last major city to have a five-cent fare. The BOT also created 14 new free transfers between the formerly-separate subway divisions. The fare increase was put forward due to increasing debt, inflation in the post-war period, expenditure on new subway routes, equipment and facilities, and maintenance of the existing system which was in disrepair. In addition, city planner Robert Moses pushed for the fare increase to allow more city funding to go towards highway development, while Transport Workers Union of America leader Michael J. Quill supported the fare hike in order to give transit workers a 30-cent per hour wage increase. In 1950, the fare of BOT surface transit was also raised to ten cents. Upon the initial 1948 increases, a twelve-cent fare had been put in place for a combined trip on the subway and either bus or trolley, but this was eliminated on July 1, 1952. The fare hikes did not effectively increase revenue for the Board of Transportation to offset increasing operation costs, while system ridership plateaued due to the American car culture and increasing migration to the suburbs. After two years of financial surplus, the BOT experienced a $1.2 million deficit in 1950, and a $24.8 million deficit in 1952. The BOT was also criticized due to the influence of politics on the organization, the direct control over the board by the mayor, and the use of the city's operating budget to subsidize transit operations. In March 1953, the New York State Legislature created the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), a public authority without direct control from a political office, with members appointed by both the Governor and Mayor. Governor Dewey signed the bill approving the creation of the TA into law on March 20, 1953. On June 15, 1953, operation of the New York City Transit System was turned over to the Transit Authority, with the Board of Estimate leasing the system to the TA for a period of ten years. The Board of Transportation, meanwhile, was dissolved. The new Transit Authority was modeled after the existing Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, the latter of which is also now part of the MTA. An entrance to the Jay Street–MetroTech subway complex adjacent to 370 Jay Street, the former Board of Transportation Headquarters. The Board of Transportation's final headquarters was located at 370 Jay Street, at the northwest corner of Jay Street and Wiloughby Street in the modern MetroTech Center of Downtown Brooklyn. The building is bound by Pearl Street to the west, and was formerly bound by Myrtle Avenue at its north end; this portion of the street has since been de-mapped. The 14-story office building was designed by architects William Haugaard and Andrew J. Thomas in post-war modernist style. The building is L-shaped, the long side along Jay Street, and the short side along the former Myrtle Avenue. The outer facade of the building consists of white limestone, with 420 square and uniformly-arranged casement windows. The building was intended to serve as the central headquarters of the BOT. The building housed 2,500 employees from several divisions of the board including its executive, legal, and engineering staff. The remainder of the building not used by the BOT would be rented out. The ground level of the building at Jay and Wiloughby Streets is designed with numerous columns forming an arcade. Haugaard, the lead designer, had drafted the design prior to World War II. Within the arcade and adjacent to the building are several entrances to the Jay Street–MetroTech subway complex, which consisted of two separate stations when the building was constructed. The location was selected in order to be in close proximity to the lines of all three subway divisions, in order to collect fares via money train. Passageways from the subway stations, including a visible door in the Jay Street IND station, lead to a money sorting room in the basement of the building. Ground broke on the site on October 8, 1948. The building was erected at a time when many other BOT transit facilities were also being built. The headquarters opened on April 1, 1951, just two years before the BOT ceased existence, and after the death of Haugaard. It cost $10 million to construct. The BOT proceeded to vacate its former headquarters, one at Hudson Street at the entrance to the Holland Tunnel in Hudson Square, Manhattan, and the other in the former Paramount Theatre in Downtown Brooklyn. Following the dissolution of the BOT, the building was used by the Transit Authority as its headquarters, and later used by the MTA with some space rented out to other organizations including the New York City Police Department. In 1990, the Transit Authority moved its primary headquarters out of 370 Jay Street, to its current location on Livingston Street. Other MTA operations were moved to 2 Broadway (now the headquarters of MTA Bridges and Tunnels) in Manhattan in 1998. In January 2006, the money train operations ended, after which the MTA largely vacated the site. The building is currently being converted for use as part of the Brooklyn Campus of New York University. ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o Report including analysis of operations of the New York City transit system for five years, ended June 30, 1945.

The well wishes and prayers have been awesome. Thanks for the update, wart! Your family is in my thoughts! He is out of surgery now, and all closed up. I have a post op picture - I won't post it. Let's just say it is heart breaking. He is a tough tough kid, I have no doubt he will recover, but it is really difficult seeing him like that. Everything is functioning the way it should, now it is on to the hard road of recovery. Very happy to hear that, wart! Good news. Continued good thoughts. I have a rare disease and had to have a fairly major surgery when I was 10 years old. My biggest worries were waking up during surgery and making it back for baseball season. Neither happened. Only now as a parent I can understand what everyone else was going through. Quick update - he is off the ventilator already, squeezed his mom's hand, and was asking for a drink! He is such a strong kid! Thank you again for all the well wishes and good vibes. Awesome news Wart, glad to hear that things are looking much better today.\n",

            "192.168.0.13 IP_ADDRESS 430 442 So I've finally got a proper router, set up my home network both upstairs and downstairs. Now I just need to find out how to stream my files from the ftp server over network (cabled) to my different computers around the house. Using Filezilla (it's easy to setup, so I used that) for the ftp server. (000015)30-05-2014 20:00:04 - admin (192.168.0.13)> 426 Connection closed; transfer aborted. (000015)30-05-2014 20:00:05 - admin (192.168.0.13)> 426 Connection closed; transfer aborted. (000015)30-05-2014 20:00:08 - admin (192.168.0.13)> disconnected. Any ideas or alternatives very welcome. I forgot to mention the server with the data is running windows 7. The other clients are running a mix of windows 7 and 8.1. I have the port range 54000-55000 forwarded and working perfectly for 2 years using this server for simple file transfers. The error comes from problems with connections between different networks, I don't know why it happens if you are using your local network. Make sure that the firewall is not the problema with the client computer. Disabling firewall doesn't seem to change anything. Tried on both ends. Maybe someone has another solution ? How about an alternative? Forget VLC? Other streaming solutions that would work over network? Doing over FTP is more trouble than it has to be. Just install Plex Media Server on the computer with the media on it and stream to other computer or devices with the Plex app or with a web browser. hmm, it downscales and reencodes my videos - that wasn't the idea. I need it to play the actual file as it is, if possible. Pretty interresting thing this Plex though. I will probably play about with it a bit more. It will be played on a computer every time, not a TV where the signal needs to be a specific format. Stream it using VLC from the server to VLC on your local network. Or install Apache and put it in a directory accessible using Apache. VLC will play videos over HTTP perfectly fine.\n",

            "123.20.35.60 IP_ADDRESS 2130 2142 Back in 1881, when 19 year old Achille Ditesheim founded Movado, I wonder if he had the vision of what this company would become. From his small village in Switzerland, is it possible he had could imagine the 100 patents and the 200 International awards that would be part of the Movado legacy…or was he, simply following his passion? Design, innovation, and quality are keywords when thinking of Movado. Creating many of the most sought-after timepieces has made Movado famous. The company didn’t stop with their dedication to beautiful design, there was enormous attention paid to functionality and comfort. In 1912 Movado patented a revolutionary movement, designed to fit into a case that was curved to the line of the wrist. These, seemingly small adjustments made huge differences in the look and feel of a Movado watch. The most well-recognized watch in the line is the Museum. It is presented with a clean, blank face, only embellished with a single dot at the 12 o’clock mark. This watch has become an iconic symbol of modern design and was the first watch to ever be chosen as part of a permanent display at the Museum of Modern Art, in New York. Movado’s delicate designs distinguish them from other watchmakers and that style, naturally transitioned the company into jewelry making. With boutiques around the world, Movado offers exquisite jewelry made from 18 ct. gold, gemstones, and their patented 114 facet Movado Diamond. Movado, literally translates into, “always in motion”, and that standard is what sets Movado apart. I for one, believe that young entrepreneur would be proud and excited to see that his vision has been expanded beyond his own imagination. Movado is style, design, and innovation at its best. Omega Watch Sales are a great find for anyone looking for a fine watch at the best price. On-line searches of Omega watches can produce substantial savings for a savvy shopper.

And a DDoS is a Distributed Denial of Service attack, where you abuse lots of computers at the same time to flood someone’s server with purposeless traffic so it can’t keep up. …before hanging up without buying anything. The enquiries seem legitimate at first, but generate no business while at the same time keeping genuine callers at the back of a long queue. Apparently, the attacks against Spamhaus were stirred up in a controversy called Stophaus, in which a countercultural posse of internet users discussed taking out Spamhaus. The Stophaus schemers, it seems, wanted to teach Spamhaus some kind of lesson for daring to take a stance against spam. The trick they used is called DNS amplification, and it works like this. DNS is the system that converts (amongst other things) internet names such as www.example.com into internet numbers such as 93.184.216.34. Ones that run on your router at home to service your home network, which simply relay your queries unaltered onwards to your ISP, or some other public server like Google’s well-known 8.8.8.8. Ones that organisations run as their own official DNS servers to give so-called authoritative answers to queries for the domains they own. Ones that will accept your queries, reply immediately if they have the answer cached already, or else recursively (a fancy word for “in their turn”) ask the authoritative servers on your behalf, cache the result for everyone else, and reply to you. Most recursive servers aren’t public, unlike Google’s 8.8.8.8, because they end up doing a lot of work and carrying a lot of traffic. So recursive servers are usually restricted to customers of a specific ISP, or to computers inside your company, or some other handily circumscribed set of users. Or, if they’re open to the public, they are carefully managed to prevent abuse. One sort of abuse is to make multiple small requests to a recursive server such that each request provokes a much bigger request-and-reply from the authoritative server belonging to your victim. Small requests turning into large ones is where the name amplification comes in. In theory, amplification attacks should be hard to do, because the majority of DNS servers aren’t supposed to be recursive – in other words, they shouldn’t pass on requests willy-nilly to other people’s servers at all. The problem was, at least when the Stophaus attack was carried out, that lots and lots of home routers – perhaps 20 million or more – were misconfigured to act as full-blown recursive servers for the whole world, as well as plain-old relay servers for the owner’s home network. So the Spamhaus attackers had millions of misconfigured DNS servers at their disposal that they could use to turn millions of modest and innocent-looking outbound DNS requests from their attack zombies into much larger amounts of DNS request-and-reply traffic, all of it aimed at Spamhaus. According to reports, Spamhaus’s DNS servers were subjected to traffic peaks of 300Gbit/sec, the sort of attack that quickly gets not only disruptive but expensive. Within a month or so, a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly taking part in the Stophaus attack scene. He couldn’t be named, being under 18, but he did put his hand up and plead guilty the following year to a bunch of offences. At the time, those offences were reported as including money laundering and child abuse, with sentencing deferred until 2015. The guilty party, having now turned 18, has recently been sentenced in Southwark crown court, and named as Seth Nolan Mcdonagh. It sounds as though he wasn’t just a piracy-loving activist-leaning youngster who fell in with older hacker/cracker types and went along for the ride. The BBC’s report suggests that Mcdonagh, who went by “narko” online, would take money to attack named websites, making him a sort of DDos gun-for-hire. In fact, “narko” apparently had £72,000 (then about $105,000) in the bank at the time of the attacks – not a bad nest-egg for a 16-year-old – plus 1000 stolen credit card numbers on his computer. Nevertheless, the court has given him a chance to reform without going to prison: he’s been sentenced to 240 hours of community service. Let’s hope Mcdonagh, now legally an adult, takes this as an opportunity, not a lucky escape. DDoS imagery courtesy of Shutterstock. people who’s credit cards were stolen and to Spamhaus for damages. I’m not sure what happened to the money…if it could be shown to be the proceeds of crime, I assume (not sure – anyone from the UK care to comment?) that it would have ended up forfeited to the Crown. lad [noun, informal]: boy or young man. I don’t know enough about the specifics of the case or about the offender to comment on the sentence, however I will say that the difference between the US sentences, which are crazily over the top, compared with this sentence don’t make any sense. 240 hours of community service?? He had £72,000 in his bank account for deeds already performed and stolen credit card numbers. I too don’t have enough knowledge of the case to form an educated opinion. Perhaps those community service hours can be put to good use by partnering with law enforcement to stop the criminal activity or restoring the loses of those attacked. Odd no mention here of him Swatting people, trying to get them killed by unwitting police. The lad will suffer and no country or law will help him as he begs for mercy. At 16 years old that kid has a lot left to learn. Cut him loose, train him, and make him work for Spamhaus deterring future attacks. He will appreciate more than anything and hopefully learn his lesson.\n",

            "303-569-2125 PHONE_NUMBER 3516 3528 Colorado has an amazing history and Deb and Jim Dysinger love sharing it with everyone who is interested. This month, the couple celebrates the one-year anniversary of Annie’s Gold Antiques and Collectibles’ move to Empire, while customers continue to rave of the new location. Both hailing from generations of collectors, the Dysinger’s have a passion for antiques while collecting and preserving history. Annie’s Gold relocated from Idaho Springs in November of last year in search of more space. “We moved to Empire when this great building became available to us,” Deb said. “We needed more room than our last shop in Idaho Springs and love the location.” The shop is now in a little, white church building, with red doors and accents at 183 Eask Park Ave. (Hwy 40). Although Empire could be considered a bit “off the beaten path,” customers say the trip up the hill is worth it, and their Grand County customers couldn’t be more pleased. Deb says their regular “antique-loving customers looking for the rare and unusual items” are finding them again which has given them a “great first year.” The locals rely on Annie’s Gold Antiques and Collectibles for gift buying because of the diverse selection of gold and silver items. “We offer our jewelry at reasonable prices, and we will gift wrap and ship,” Deb said. The Dysinger’s feel they have one of the most extensive mining collections for sale in a shop in Colorado and buy antiques from locals and online. Annie’s Gold offers a large variety of antiques and collectibles such like antique sterling silver flatware and hollowware, vintage Christmas collection, Waterford, Baccarat, Belleek, Paden City, Fenton, Cambridge, art glass, Ken Nelson earring collection and fine estate jewelry. If interested in mining items, check out the blasting cap crimpers, blasters, maps, photographs, miners candlesticks, tram cars and ore buckets along with primitives, linens, glass, crystal, hardware and more. They also house a library filled with Colorado information as well has a reference library. Deb got her thrill-of-the-find type curiosity from her father who always wanted to be a gold miner. He would collect 100s of mining claims and mills in Clear Creek, Cripple Creek, Lake, Park and Teller counties over the span of four decades. Acting as his “Girl Friday,” Deb helped by mapping, finding corner markers on claims acquired and driving her dad to meeting after meeting. Local Assay reports state almost 90 percent of the gold and silver in these claims have yet to be recovered, but due to the current state of the economy and current mining and milling laws, the value of these claims has dropped significantly since the cost to mine is too steep. “The gold and silver may never make it to the surface with current laws,” she said, “but it is down there.” Deb and Jim find the true value of these claims are their history. Jim’s extensive knowledge of antiques comes from his parents’ antique and collecting business, which they had for 60 years. A far cry from the three-piece-suit Jim wore in his banking days, he has spent the last 10 years learning and studying all he can on mining and artifacts of Clear Creek county. He says he doesn’t miss those days in a cubical and looks forward to their next great antique find. Customer must stop in often to see what Annie’s Gold Antiques and Collectibles has to offer, because nothing lasts too long and there is always something new to learn and see. The Dysingers are available at the store or by calling 303-569-2125. Tags: Annie's Gold Antiques & Collectables, Empire. Bookmark the permalink.\n",

In fact, according to the American Dental Association, the average adult between the ages of 20 and 64 has three or more decayed or missing teeth. While this makes tooth replacement a common dental procedure, patients in Southlake, Texas, have prosthodontist Dr. Khaldoun Ajlouni to turn to for guidance on just what option works best depending on their unique circumstances. Sometimes tooth replacement may involve a combination of these treatments, such as dentures that are supported with two or more dental implants, or implants used to anchor dental bridges. To get a better feel for what option may be best for you, contact us today by calling 817-251-9333. We’ll plan each phase of your tooth replacement with the end goal in mind: a beautiful, strong smile.\n",

Here it is revised with Graham and Brad's feedback. Any further edits before I use the quote? \"The suggestion there's anything unusual about our joint victory funds has no basis in the law or reality, as recognized by numerous independent experts that have looked at this. The fact is both campaigns signed on to similar agreements. While only one campaign is currently using their joint victory fund we encourage both of our campaigns to identify opportunities to support the national and state Democratic parties now so that we can continue to build the infrastructure to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November.\" - DNC Communications Director On Background: * The money raised by the joint victory funds, even when the money goes to the DNC, still helps state parties. The funds help strengthen, for example, our national voter file and communications, research and digital support for state parties and down ballot candidates. That includes training across a variety of areas, for example, and access to media monitoring and rapid response support. This is helping the Party right NOW build the infrastructure we need for the general election. * Politico got it wrong. Their claim that state parties only get to keep 1 percent of all the money being raised is incorrect and comparing apples and oranges. They reference the total amount of money that has been raised, but of that, many millions HAVE BEEN RAISED FOR STATE PARTIES AND JUST HASN'T BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO THEM YET (NOR HAS IT GONE TO THE DNC OR ANYWHERE ELSE). Because this is money for the general election, and coordinated campaigns are just now starting to be built at state parties, it is perfectly understandable that not all of the HVF money owed to state parties would have been distributed yet. * We had JFA' s with the Obama campaigns in 2008 and 2012, and the Kerry campaign in 2004. And while the funds are going to the DNC right now to build tools and capacity for the general election, there will be a point when the funds stay in the states to fund coordinated campaigns that are now beginning to get organized. * That's why experts have agreed there's nothing unusual about the victory funds. Rick Hasen, an influential academic on campaign finance, posted an analysis on the Election Law Blog that addressed this issue. Hasen states in the article that \"it is hard to see what provision of the law\" is at issue. As the blog points out, \"legally\" the criticism of the fund \"seems weak.\" http://electionlawblog.org/?p=81996<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__electionlawblog.org_-3Fp-3D81996&d=CwMFAg&c=XRWvQHnpdBDRh-yzrHjqLpXuHNC_9nanQc6pPG_SpT0&r=ztfeb3sYMwYJc4m6DQzcZ1EDxKmQmE8pe5TrXm4gdCU&m=xosCmCfJlZ5AfIscnIGFPlKd_WqB4JHLY4vSLilK-IE&s=IDZd2_ULQhvZFm33gwH-mCSwcJMtMpjuFI5_FJQQvqk&e=> * We welcome any effort by our candidates to help raise money for the DNC and state parties. * Similar agreements were set up with both the Clinton campaign and the Sanders campaign early in the cycle, precisely because of the urgency to build a strong national infrastructure now that will help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November. The Sanders campaign has not used theirs. * These arrangements are not new or unusual. Similar joint fundraising committees were established with our Democratic candidate in both 2008 and 2012. And again, both campaigns have signed on and have the option of using joint victory funds. * And let's be clear, neither the DNC nor state parties are subsidizing fundraising through these committees for either campaign.

In the sub-headline that say that state parties only get to keep 1 percent of all the money being raised, but that is really incorrect and comparing apples and oranges. They reference the total amount of money that has been raised, but of that, many millions haven't yet been moved from HVF to state parties, but it also hasn't gone to the DNC or anywhere else. Because this is money for the general election, and coordinated campaigns are just now starting to be built at state parties, it is perfectly understandable that not all of the HVF money owed to state parties would have been distributed yet. - I would lean so heavily on Hasen specifically in our on the record quote, as he could always come out and say something different. I think it is worth keeping that in the background materials, but given that others, when asked, also said there wasn't really anything to this, maybe we just keep the on the record quote more general?

The event attracts male and female riders from across the Fraser Valley and Fraser Canyon. It’s organized into six classes, and is open to all motorcycle models, sizes and powers. “The bikes have personalities because for a lot of people, it’s their dream and vision of what a bike is and they do it through modifications,” said Victor Smith, president of the Hope & District Chamber of Commerce. This year, the show is taking place in conjunction with a new barbecue cook-off and kids watermelon eating contest in Memorial Park. The cook-off starts at 11 a.m., with judges awarding prizes in the afternoon. The watermelon eating contest, sponsored by Cooper’s Foods and Buy & Save Foods, begins at 2 p.m. There will also be live music with Skinny’s Blues Crew throughout the day as well as belly dancing performances from Temple of the Belly.

            "760-508-4562 PHONE_NUMBER 2549 2561 Now available a solution to the high cost of racing fuel. Race Gas is not an octane booster, but it will genuinely increase octane. $2 per ounce will raise any gasoline 2 octane points per US gallon. So to raise 10 gallons of California 91 octane @ $3.80 per gallon to 95 octane and allow a CR of 11.5:1 with a 236 @ .050 In Dur. with aluminum heads will cost you $20 for 10oz, plus $38 for the 10 gallons, which works out to $5.80 per gallon. Or you could buy 5 gallons of Motorsport 100 octane for $85, mix it 50/50 for 95.5 octane at a cost of $10.4 per gallon. Klotz 108 is $12.20 per gallon so adding 3.75 gallons to 91 to make cost to 95 octane would cost $6.95 per gallon. Klotz 118 leaded gasoline is $14.2 per gallon. Mixing 2 gallons with 91 will get you close to 95 octane, at $5.88 per gallon. So if you use N2O or a blower, you can just carry a can of race Gas on board and tip the can when to plan to use you increased cylinder pressure potential and not have a tank of racing gasoline that you don't need at less than full throttle.

Back in the day and still today to a lesser extent you could hop up your street car and go drag racing, but it has become less poplar. What is popular is modifying cars for drift racing. The Chev LS3 engine is fantastic for this purpose and these engine are being swapped into all kinds of import cars. but I have Also Shipped To Russia And I Supply Gen 3 LS Engines To China For Off Road Racing. I Build Both Wicked Powerful Monsters And More Modest Lower Cost Hopped Up Mills. I Focus On Exporting Because I Can Really Help You Reduce The Final Price You Pay. I'll Supply You The Combination Of Parts & Labor At American Pricing. No Middleman Markup Or Importation Fees Added To The Cost. I Send The Motor At Minimal Shipping Cost In A Car Transport Container, Safer Than General Shipping Companies. All Combined This Reduces The GST You Pay. I Have Found Over The Last 12 Years That People Who Buy Engines From Me Do So After Emails And Phone Calls. I Provide A Few Pages Of Engine Examples, but Email Me And Tell Me What You Want. My Pricing Is Competitive In The US, But It Is Much Lower Than V8 Engines Can Be Built Overseas. I Build Many Of The Engines Myself, However I Also Have A Network Of Engine Builders I Work With Who Build Engines For Me. Look For \"LINK BARS\" Though Out This Site For Examples Of Engines I can Supply. Bottom Line. My cell phone number is 760-508-4562 I'm Not Selling Engines From This Website I Build Or Supply For Specific Request, So You Need To Contact Me. I Am A Customer Engine Builder And Auto Parts Exporter, I Am Also Involved In Other Projects. I Only Build A limited Number Of Engines Each Year. If You Are Looking For Something Special Or Looking For A Good Deal, Write Or Phone And Find Out If I'm Your \"Go-To Guy\". Compare my quote and combination to the big companies and see if you don't get more for your money. I am John Nijssen aka Stroker John. I Have Been Providing Performance V8 Engine Solutions Since 2001. I am not limited to what I build. I mostly build motors for overseas, however I still build plenty of engines for the American market. I am selling my services, I build performance V8 engines, I do not have engines for sale. I am not going to try to talk you into anything, I am not a salesman, I am an engine builder who is self employed. I am not a boss, I work alone, but hire other shops to help me as I have tons of builds to complete. I mentioned on the front page I built this website. I am not selling engines from this site, it's provide information and enjoyment. I use multiple machine shops depending on what I need done. and a diamond hone and know how to use it. I will buy other builders engines for you and ship them if that is a better solution for you. There are shops building reliable \"create\" or \"budget\" motors using resources I can not match, so I ally with them. Be caution the warranty on low cost builds is not very useful. I will buy things from ebay, racingjunk and craislist if you see something there. This is my new website, I haven't finished it yet. It is a little self indulgent, but I did it myself and wanted to show I am unique. I realize you are looking for an engine and the question on your mind is \"what does it cost?\" I don't sell engines I build them. You can look on Proformance Unlimited or ATK or The Engine Factory etc website and see what they sell their engines for. I build more power for a little lower cost. I add 5% to my cost of the parts, plus whatever labor is involved and there is the price. How much are you planning on spending? Write to me for a estimate. I'm sure you are looking at other engine websites. You will see some builders selling at higher prices than others, but most have similar pricing. That is because that's what that specific combination cost after adding a little profit to pay for the rent. This website is intended to get you, if you are seriously looking to build a powerful engine to email me. I prefer emails because I have a record of what was said. So look through the site, I have photos and videos of past builds, but I've never built two motors the same. What are you looking for, more power or less cost. I am a New Zealander living in the USA since 1982. Before that I completed an apprenticeship in New Zealand as an Automotive Machinist graduating top of my class. I then built an altered and did some drag racing. Then the plan was to move to California and get a job on a top fuel team. I did get a short stint at doing that, but the team dissolved and without intending to I found myself working in a machine shop and before I knew it I was married and twenty years had gone by. It was then I decided to began building custom performance V8 engines in 2001. I came to the USA because I wanted to work on V8 engines, but there is no fun in building stock motors and rather than working for someone else I open Stroker Engine. As a \"Motorhead\" I will discuss any type of motor. I keep an eye open for the latest thinking in performance improvements. While I show a number of motor options in this site, they are only examples, I can come up with most anything you want. When it is over my head, I have people who step up to help me. I do Clevelands, I don't feature a \"crate\" engine version as most tend to be Clevors, however there are still a few 351C blocks around to build more stock looking combinations. Recent combinations I have built include a Ford Windsor for a hualing truck making 580 torque at 3500rpm, a small block Chev making 715 horsepower for a dirt drag trike. I'm currently building a 765CID BBC. a manifold, oil pan, rocker stands and pushrods. I did this big block Mopar using an 8-71 blower to make 875Hp at 6000rpm on pump petrol. A big block 540 Chev kicking out 710Hp at 5500rpm. I intend this site as both a place to find engines and also a tech resource, although you will need to dig through my site there is tons of stuff here. Check out the Tech Page, I'm constantly adding to it. I'm often asked what CID should I get. In my opinion it really is a question of how much torque the drive train can handle. A 350 or 650 CID motor can handle 6000rpm so that's not the issue. More CID makes more torque. More torque is harder to get traction. Once you have traction, then you can start breaking things. If you are overseas and want an LS engine, I can supply complete USED engine packages. See tab at top of the page to return. The Site Map provides links to all the pages in this site. ​The Tech Info page has links to all kinds of subjects. The Art Carr TH200R4 is a great choice. I do supercharged engines, GMC Procharger Whipple Torqstorm. Video library of automotive basics Click Here.\n",

He is author of over 30 publications, including The Great Crossover, The 21st Century Agent, Creative Destruction, and How The Best Get Better. Jason: Welcome to the Speaking of Wealth show Episode#4. This is your host Jason Hartman where we discuss profit strategies for speakers, publishers, and consultants. I hope you enjoyed the last few episodes. Last one we talked to Dan Poynter, the self publishing guru, and you know what he talks about is really a large part of a democratic society I think because self publishing really allows everybody to get the word out about their topic, or their area of expertise. It”s no longer a situation where this is decided by just a few big network media outlets or a few big publishers. Everybody can self publish nowadays and get the word out, and build their own following their own tribe as Seth Gordon says. Their own audience. So I hope you enjoyed that one, and then I hope you enjoyed Episode #2 Ann Bruce where we talked about how to speak for a living and then number one was with Harvey Mackay you know him of course the bestselling author multiple times over. Mr. Swim with the Sharks, Harvey Mackay and today I would like to bring over an episode from one of my other shows and that is the Creating Wealth show which I have been doing for about five years. We”ve got well over 180 episodes now, and this one I thought would be particularly interesting to speakers, publishers, consultants, coaches, and so forth because this one is with Dan Sullivan, the strategic coach. And he talks about business, and how to grow your business, how to expand your business. I”ve been following his content for many years since I discovered him through Young Entrepreneurs Organization kind of a sister organization to YPO Young Presidents Organization at their university several years back in New York City and Dan Sullivan is just a great guy. So we got two Dan”s in a row here. And let”s go to the interview with Dan Sullivan the strategic coach taken Creating Wealth show Episode#123. I think you will really enjoy this as a speaker, publisher and consultant. We will be back with that in just a second. Introduction: What”s great about the show is you will find on jasonhartman.com is that if you want to learn how to finance your next big real estate deal, there is a show for that. If you want to learn more about food storage, and the best way to keep those onions from smelling up everything else there is a show for that. If you honestly want to know more about business ethics, there is a show for that. And if you just want to get away from at all, and need to know something about world travel, there is even a show for that. Yeah there is a show for just about anything only from jasonhartman.com or type in Jason Hartman in the iTune store. Jason: It”s my pleasure to welcome Dan Miller to the show. He is the President of 48 days and he specializes in creative thinking and increase personal and business success, helping people discover their unique natural gifts in integrating them into career choices, new career choices, and business choices. Dan it”s great to have you on the show. Dan: Thank you Jason. I am looking forward to talking to you. Jason: Well, likewise. Tell us a little about what is it you do? Dan: I am a author and life coach, and usually the tags that I hang behind my name. I”ve had the privilege of moving into more and more writings in the last few years, but got into this kind of space by being a career coach discovered there were so many people basing inevitable and relentless job transitions and so I have to place here many years now working with people who were looking at making those changes, and these are usually people that are not having not just lost the job at Taco Bell, but often people who feel trapped by virtue of their academic training, so physicians, attorneys, dentists, pastors who really often at 45 years old wake up and say I am living somebody else”s dream. This is not my dream. Help me make a change, and so I help people make those changes, see what the opportunities are often by really taking a for instance look at the new kind of work models that we have today available and they really are exploding all around us even as we speak, so its not just a matter of where can I go and get a job, and have them guarantee me a paycheck, give me a paycheck on Friday and a 401k contribution and medical benefits that mean I would be part of what the new opportunity looks like, but I am excited about helping people in that arena. And then as a result I do a lot of writing. I have written a couple of different books that address those kind of issues and help people understand what their options are. Jason: Well fantastic, so Dan what are some of the new opportunities out there. We live in such an innovative world, and I marvel at it everyday at how capitalism is just such a wonderfully freeing thing for the human spirit, and how it just every possible need any of us could imagine someone is there to fill it. It”s just amazing. Jason: But with the internet and with the ability to have a home based business, a small business, and level that playing field or flattened that playing field a little bit. The little guy really has a lot of opportunities nowadays don’t they probably more than ever before. Dan: Yeah absolutely right. I love the way you frame that. Capitalism is a freeing experience, and that it is. And it is, has never been easier to become a player than what it is today. You know with the internet, and that”s not just the magic tool for everybody, but certainly it opens some doors, it kind of flattens the world so to speak where you can be a player in a real tiny, tiny niche. I mean you can have sun glasses for dogs where you could never justify opening in a retail store for that because there wouldn”t be enough people within the geographic radius, but if you are on the internet you instantly have accessed to the entire world theoretically, and you can get a really tiny, tiny portion of the prospects there, and still knock it on the park. You know I”ve done that with my own personal books where I love books. It would be real tempting for me to open a nice clean little bookstore in Franklin, Tennessee, and what its for real term where I realized I am never going to do that. There is nowhere in the world. You know where I am going to confine myself to a five mile radius of prospects? No. I had a bookstore on the internet, and because of that we get orders from literally all over the world that amazes me everyday. Its never seem too amazed, and how we had penetrated in to another countries beyond the United States. Now it is easy to start a business. Also when we use to talk about starting the business we would think about a bolly-nolly service station, hardware store, bookstore something like that, but today the most profitable business often don’t have any bricks and mortar at all. They are using service information or technology as their key concept, and so somebody can become a player right along with a major, major company you can make yourself look like a player in that same space by simply having a nicely designed website and offering service a value to people. Jason: And what are some of these innovative businesses, of course you mentioned kind of half sarcastically sun glasses for dogs, but only half sarcastically I think. What are some of the really unique things you are seeing out there because there is just a limitless number of ideas aren”t there? There is a website for everything. Dan: There really is. And again I love the web, and what its able to do, and I have seen people take very common ideas and do really well there, but also I don”t want to make that just the cookie cutter solution for everybody. There are opportunities for people who are not tech-savvy to do something with the unique skill that they have, and still do extremely well. We have on our property here in Franklin, Tennessee a tree that got damaged in the storm a couple of years ago beyond restoration. Well, been an old farm kid I hate losing a tree and I could hardly bare the thought of just cutting this thing down than having an ugly stump to deal with. So I called, made a couple of phone calls, called the place who repairs my chainsaw. I said aren”t that people that carved in wood. Well, they gave me a number I called. He gave me a another number. I talked to a lady. She said well, you know I carve in wood, but I never done a standing tree. I have only done things on my bench in my shop, but if you are open to it, I would be happy to come out and take a look with you. I said well, come on out. Well, she did, she carved two faces one on either side of that dead tree in our yard. Now these we call at our wisdom guard and we actually have created a little garden around it. Kids love to come up, and touch this faces. They are about four feet tall. It looks like we got Abraham and Moses looking to cross our yard in either directions, so we took what was going to be an ugly stump and transformed into an permanent piece of art in our property. Now, here is the thing about that lady. She had been a corporate executive, never married was making a very reasonable income, and just realized that her soul was being sucked out, or she sat at a cubicle everyday and she kind of tapped into her passion. So she said read one of my books 48 days To The Work You Love. She says helped her do that realize she was off base instead of doing this kind of work. Now, the interesting about this is you would never ever meet with your high school or college, guidance counselor, and they would say you need to grew up and be a tree carver. Dan: Well, you are not going to find that in the dictionary of occupational titles. Its way too individualized, but that”s just really in part. You can find something that is so individualized, so personalized that it engages your unique passions, dreams, and values, and do extremely well. There really isn”t much barrier to entry. That means and may it be intimidating to some people think well, gee I am not an entrepreneur. I am not a Donald Trumpeted turn to kind of person you don’t have to be. You can shape the idea around what is unique about you. And that”s really where we get the power of these ideas is in finding things that are I will ask them to accept. I”ve got a tree carver I couldn”t do that. But for this lady that tapped into some childhood passions that she had, and it was a perfect fit for her. I”ve got a gentlemen who came to me as a — actually as a pastor, and he thought he was doing something very godly, but at the same time it was very frustrating just eking out of living. He was working as a desk clerk at a hotel during the weeknights in order to just keep the lights on in his house because they were struggling so much financially. It came to me, and we”ve kind of peeled the onion so to speak which is always the case. We don’t have to just put something on top of the person and say here is the best opportunity or trend. It”s usually a matter of looking inward first. What does make you tick? What puts you in the zone? What is it that when you are doing at time just flies by? Well, with this young guy he would talk about going into a room in their house, closing the door, he would put on Beethoven and Mozart, and he would draw just as dramatic abstract paintings, had never sold anything in his life, but he would do that just kind of as a personal release and cleansing. I hadn’t quit what he was doing. Everything he was doing including pasturing the church. And for four years he did though finishes were he would use brushes, punches, rags and produces dramatic effects on the walls of peoples businesses and homes, but that gave him the freedom to do this really beautiful paintings. Today he doesn’t do full finishes at all. He simply does these paintings. I have one hanging here in my office, so they gave me just out of appreciation for the transformation he experienced and it’s a $10,000 painting which is pretty typical of his work at his point. And here is the interesting thing about that. If I wanted to just simply address his financial needs would I have suggested that we come an artist? Well, we know we hear about artist start being an artist, and we have hundreds of them in any city in America, but if that is really his authentic fit that”s his best opportunity to find work that is fulfilling meaningful purposeful and profitable. And with him at this point his income, he estimates his income is 12 to 15 times what he would ever have made as a pastor. We didn’t do it because of the money, but the money showed up because it was an authentic fit. And I think that”s what a lot of people are missing Jason where they are just trying to do something well that they don’t really believe that may think they”ve been responsible by just trying to do something to produce a paycheck that”s a horrible trade-off to make. Jason: I remember from years ago Dan, and what you are saying reminds me of it. One of my great mentors was Earl Nightingale. I am also a huge fan of Denis Waitley and Zig Ziglar of course, and all those from kind of the old school of motivational speakers and writers and so forth, but I remember one of the things Earl Nightingale taught me many years ago. He said that there were two types of people, two types of actually I should distinguish successful people. One type is the river person and the type is the goal person. And you were just making me think of that because what he says is he says the river people are those just fortunate souls who kind of always know what they wanted to do, and what their passion was. And all they had to do in life is just be in that river of interest so if its music they would be the most art of it was painting. They could be the next Michelangelo or Da Vinci or whoever, and all they had to do is be in it because they were so passionate about it, so interested and so consumed by it that it really wasn”t work for them. Then he says for most of us though, if we are not a river person or we haven’t discovered our river of interest yet, and I know you help people do that, so I definitely want to hear more about that. It”s just incumbent on us to be goal people and set goals, and achieve them progressively, but I guess at some point like you say the goal person and I can be a drag baby if its so far out of alignment with ones passion and interest in life, right? Dan: Absolutely. Those goals are to getting you closer and closer; closer to what is the true passion. If you are just trying to again make yourself do that. It”s sometimes people they had that perception of goals, that it just kind of forces you to do the right thing. Goals ought to be the very true expression of what you really want to accomplish in your life. They just help you get there quicker. Jason: Well, how can one — I mean I love the questions you just mentioned. What turns you on? What are your passion is about? What sort of moves you, but how can someone really know what their thing is because I talk to people and I try to counsel them, and helped them when they come to me with this sort of dilemma and what should I do with the rest of my life, or whether they are young, or middle age, or older? People live so long nowadays, and have so many choices that sometimes just the choices can be really daunting. How can someone really identify what”s right for them? Dan: You know people struggle with this a lot whether they are still trying to find their passion, their purpose, destiny calling how we want to frame that but just to make it easy just describe what their passion is. I don’t really understand why it”s so difficult, and I work with people. I have been doing this for 25 years, and I still don’t — its still concerns me, and makes me scratch my head to find people who don’t recognize their own passions easier. And I have a two year old granddaughter who spends a lot of time with me because her momma works for me. It”s not very difficult at all to see what her passions are. I mean you walk to a Wal-Mart store you are going to know real quick what little _____ [0:17:19] cares about. Jason: For a two year old? Jason: Now tell us about that you know. Dan: Well, she is so transparent. I mean if its teddy bears as opposed to doll babies, or if it”s something in the — if it”s been outside you know rather than being can bind inside, but she is extremely transparent. The foods she likes the same kind of foods that I do you know. She goes with me to Mexican restaurants and likes the salsa and chips, and that she doesn”t care for peas and carrots. I mean she is so transparent in things that she is really drawn to. And at adult seem to have just pulled bailed cloud down over their eyes where they just don’t even really understand what they enjoy and what they don’t. Now, I understand that you know light happened, and sometimes we can kind of come become numb to things like that. I did a seminar not too a long ago, and the gentlemen right in the front row was very attentive during the seminar was talking about living out your dreams, holding on your dreams and living those out, and he came up afterwards and he says, I really don’t have any dreams. And I said how is that possible? How could you be breathing living person and not at any dreams? I said what you do, and he described that he is the pharmacist, has been for 17 years and what he described was what we referred to as the frog in the cattle phenomenon. Now I don’t think if its exactly scientifically true if it makes a good point. We are told that if you put a frog in hot water, he will jump out. But if you put a frog in lukewarm water, and slowly turn up the heat, they would sit there, and cook to death. And I find that that kind of happens to a lot of adults. They grew up, got out of schools, started a life, and the changes have been slow and subtle, and they just comia pyorittaa suuri ja vakavarainen Mansion Limited, ja kokemus nakyy: Casino . never paid attention to them, and all of a sudden they are brain dead. They don’t really notice anymore what really appeals to them. I have here on our property where I do my coaching and most people come in at least for the first part of that process. I often take them on one of my nature trails. We just go for a walk, and if I see a busy CEO I see the $400,000 year CEO, and he doesn’t notice the squirrels. He doesn’t see the beautiful red cardinals setting in the bushes we walk by. He doesn’t any of those horses that were playing together. It gives me a real good indication of why his life is so dull and meaningless. They just has stopped seeing things around them, so my encouragement again without making anybody feel guilty is to pay attention to those things that are right under your nose. Be reminded again of what it is that you really enjoy. What brings you joy? What puts you in the zone? We talk about happily to be in the zone. What is it that does that for you? I can imagine people not having those indicators. That”s why I prefer to work with people who have had a lot of life experience. Its tough to do this when they are 20 years old. But by the time somebody has had a little life experience then we can look back, and we started to see all those benchmarks, those recurring themes, and its in those that we get more and more confirmation. This is what”s going to make sense for you. This is the kind of work you ought to be doing. This is how you ought to be working with other people. This is how you ought to be leading and we get all those kind of things just by peeling back the layers of life that have already happened and looked at those. I tell people Jason that 85% of the process of having the confidence of proper direction comes from looking inward. 15% of the application that”s the easy part, but a lot of people go directed to the application who is hiring, what”s the best franchise you could possibly get into, what are the trends in business. Those are recipes for what can be very short term solutions and long term frustration. But if you take a deep breath, look in were take the time to do that you ought to come out with a clear confidence of having a proper focus its going to give you a sense of meaning in applied work in that area. Jason: Yeah good points. What else do you cover in your work? I mean unique business models, finding what one is truly passionate about, and in your body of work Dan what else is there to it. Is there more? Dan: There is. I have a lot of moving pieces in what I do. I am a big believer in having what is coming. I will refer to as multiple streams of income. Jason: Very good, yeah so I like that. And I think all of our listeners do too. Dan: Okay I would become bored quickly if I were doing only one thing even though there are certain things that I enjoy a lot. I do love coaching. I love working with people, but I only do that one day a week, let”s say you are going to say well, why don”t you”re doing it five days a week? I mean it”s extremely profitable? Why don’t you do it five days a week? No. I could not bring the same kind of energy and enthusiasm to that process if I had non-stop clients sitting in front of me five days a week. We just — so I do it one day a week. Then I have time where I do just writing. No, I have a lot, certainly a lot of time for speaking. I have had all the pleasure of working with a lot of coaches. We have a coaching network. And here is and they seem to be kind of an irony in the business model, but it”s been extremely successful for me, and that is I have a lot of people over the years coming to me, and say Dan I want to do what you are doing. Show me how to do what you have done. Well, you can think that that”s going to meet — I am going to have a lot of competitors. I”m creating my own competition and that stability in the market, but that”s been an extremely profitable area for me to specialize in so I have a lot of people who are also coaches that I work with, but not only do I work with individual clients, but then I also coach coaches. I think you can find those kinds of opportunities in any given industry, in any given position where you just find creative ways to provide value, so I have a lot of — I mean I have a difficult time saying no to all of the new opportunities that are appearing just in what I do, and really I”m just an author and coach and you would think well, Jesus things are kind of slow right now. Here is an interesting component on that. I have coaches contacted me right now. Then Dan how can I possibly make a living as a coach because you know right now we are in a recession. People are only purchasing necessities. Nobody is going to spend money on coaching when times are as tough as thing. And I am thinking you go to be kidding me. We had over three million people lose their jobs in the last 24 months. How could this not be the greatest time in history to be a career coach? Isn’t just like shooting fish in the barrel, but see here is what happens, and that you have been listening to people like the Denis Waitley and Earl Nightingale and Napoleon Hill and the people that you mentioned previously understand there is principle, those same people who wills say how can I possibly make it as a career coach when times are tough. Guess what happens when things around and we”ve got full employment. They are going to say oh my gosh, who needs me now. Everybody has got a job. See the mentality precedes circumstances. Jason: Certainly I completely agree with you if there is much more to be said for the concept of the self fulfilling prophecy, and you know we used to have the senator here in California S. I. Hayakawa years ago wrote a rather renowned book about it, and it’s a great quote. He said the self fulfilling prophecy is something that is neither true nor false yet it is capable of becoming true if it is believed and that”s exactly what you are saying. Jason: People make it true. Dan: And there is a disagreement and Henry Ford to similar whether you think you can, or think you can either way you are right. Dan: Yup and I found out to be so true in times like these made everybody wonders if these are the worst of times. Well, there are just times. We”ve been through this before, but I find in this particular time everybody knows that of course new building construction, housing constriction is in the tank. I sell to one of my friends this morning who is in that space. He builds high end homes. He says he is trying to avoid answering the phone because he is so far behind and the work that he is committed and have so many people knocking on his door, and have been build new homes for him. We got to be careful about this generalities. There are people who are doing. I talk to a friend in the mortgage business recently, and again they have been really hammered hard. I said you know well, how things going expecting to sell, man I am barely speaking. He said I just had the best month there I had in my life. He said that the rates we”ve got right now, we are doing refinances faster than we can get people in and out of the door. No matter what the industry there is still opportunity if you see it differently, and we know that car sales are really in the tank right now especially American made cars, and then those motorcycles are down, not as much as cars because a lot of people discovered the motor cycles are more economical, but here is an irony. Are you familiar with Jesse James? It makes high end customized motor cycles. They start at a $150,000. Dan: Now surely you would think well, he is toast in this kind of economy. No he has a four year waiting list. A four year waiting list, if he stops selling another one right now he would work for four years just trying to fulfill the orders for bikes that start at a $150,000. We just have to be careful about this generalizations. Dan: And look for opportunities and recognize opportunities that other people don’t see. Jason: Now, Dan I will hope you will forgive me, but I want to play Devil”s Advocate with you for a moment. Dan: Oh go for it because I think there are sort of two sides to this issue. So couple of things, number one is people listening to this will say well come on, be a realist, and what I find most of the time is realism is just an excuse for pessimism, so I want you to know where I am coming from I say this. However, isn”t this sort of discontent sometimes the thing that gets the person to jump to the new better opportunity? On one hand you want to say look, the old saying there are no small parts, only small actors, right that”s a valid thing. And there is opportunity at every business I am sure, but if someone today is just fighting the tide in a changing industry or in the job market where their jobs are being outsourced to India, China and wherever else, the whole impetus to make the leap to something new is to be discontented right. Jason: So where is the balance in this thinking in that? Dan: How may times I hear from people, I heard from the lady today I said you know how could I possibly be created when we are struggling so much financially, but here is the challenge in that thinking when somebody is not struggling financially its very easy become contented with the status quo, and just continuing doing that. Immediate reaction from almost everybody who loses a position and that we hear from lots of them is thinking oh, we are going to have to take the kids out of private school turn back in the cars we have, give up the vacation this year, or stop with our country club membership. They always think less and yet you know what 18 months after that I so freak away here you know what that”s the best thing that ever happened, and they — because it forced me to look at new options. I realized I was not taking advantage of opportunities that I had, and I am in a much better place to do than I was then. We are not here that just so often it gets old in hearing it so does it require disaster to force us to be creative for better. Dan: I hope that it doesn’t. Jason: Right, but sometimes it does. It’s a wake up call. Dan: I want and create people to take the initiative, but it is difficult to take the initiative when things are going well, and does a lot of times in retrospect it was what appeared to be something unfortunate around wealth and not least prompted somebody, but then take the initiative and they end up in a better place. I don’t want to minimize at all the challenge that a lot of people are facing right now with hard times, and it may be difficult to think creatively when the mortgages due three days from now, or three days from ago, and you think u know just got to do some, but still in that space is the time we expect to be creative, expect new ideas, expect to see things that you have never seen before. Be reading, talking to people, going to workshops and seminars that are everywhere, don’t cost anything, you know get on the internet listen to podcast like this, get new ideas so you can take a fresh look at who you are, what you are prepared for, what you are going to move into the next season in your life. If somebody had a job for 20 years, I have been working with the gentlemen right now. He has had the same job for 25 years, and now it”s clear. They are trying to get him to quit on his own initiative, so they don’t have to give him anything that they would have to say fired him. Anyway that’s a real common scenario being played out. Well he is terrified, at least he was and so we started to looking at this. I said my gosh you had the same job for 25 years. You really haven”t had that much of an increase in compensation, at least paid pretty well, but that it really hasn’t been dramatically himself. Do you think that you perhaps are a different person then you were 25 years ago? Are you more skilled then you were 25 years ago? You have opportunities changed where you would be more of a employer. I mean there is all kinds of things in his favor, and I think you can walk out of that and double this compensation even if he just wants another traditional job. Jason: Sometimes that lay off or getting fired from that job like you said it”s the best wake up call, so unfortunate and unwelcome, but so many times and we have all heard the stories Dan about how that led to the inspiration that really created some great new thing for the person going through it. I can”t remember who it was, but they say there is basically two ways people get motivated by either inspiration or desperation. Jason: And I know there are a lot of desperate scenarios out there today, no question. Dan: I had it probably going in here too. I mean I wasn’t exactly born with the silver spoon in my mouth. I mean I haven”t been where I am for a long period of time. You know what people see of me today you know as a successful author and coach, and you know we had other company and interesting things like that. That’s happened pretty quickly. I mean I had a period of time, and I was 42 years old and this happened. When I was 42 years old, I crashed and burned big time. I mean I came out of the business disaster. I owed the IRS and vendors about $450,000, and I thought it”s never going to get any worst than this. But at that time I knew I had a couple of clear options. Now I could go get a job. I mean I could get a job teaching at the university, you know get my $60,000 or whatever, you know and be okay with that, but I knew with what I was facing in terms of repaying debt that I owed I would never see the light of the day. If I did that, if I just got a traditional job, I wouldn’t live long enough to have any kind of a life and repay my real obligations. I knew I was going to have to do something creative again. So even in that space is desperate as I was, and believe me we were. I mean IRS took our house, our cars. I didn’t have a car. I borrowed a car from a friend, an old beat up _____ [0:33:24] car just so I could get from point A to point B. Started from that, but I resisted doing something just traditional even thought our utilities were shut off, and all the horrible things that you hear about. But I jumped back in as a creative person actually in that space I needed income quickly and I took a position in sales totally commission. No guarantee, no base, no salary, nothing. Totally commission, just give me the opportunity, and I went out, and did my best, and started creating income very quickly again. And not that that was my dream position, it”s certainly was not in any way, but it was something that I could do immediately, and allowed me to start thinking again long term. What am I going to do, where am I going to end up, a year, three years, five years from now? So developed overtime that I have been in a place where I hear these people talking today gee, I”ve got $15,000 in debt, and I just lost my job you know where they are going to give me a severance package for six months of income, and I”m thinking jeez. Jason: That’s a total blessing. I never had a severance package in my life. Dan: It”s better because you have it, and then to repay for six months, just figure what you want to do in the next season of your life. Jason: I know. It”s a great thing, that’s really phenomenal. This is definitely been an inspiring talk, and I think one of the things the listeners need to really remember is that gems are polished by friction, steel is hardened by fire, and these hardships in life if handled correctly they really do lead to greener pastures and better things. And when you look back on them may be years later, may be even months later, you think boy, I”m so glad it worked out this way. Everything is just kind of always works out, so it”s definitely an inspiring talk. Well, Dan what would you like people to know just to kind of wrap this whole thing up. Dan: Well I would love to just what people know about some of the things that we have going on, and then they helped them in their own journey. I mean we have a social networking site. I kind of hesitate to call up that because it reminds people of MySpace in Facebook where you just go in and put in what you had for breakfast this morning. I think we are really interested in that, but it”s an idea of network. 48days.net and it”s just a whole bunch of happy people who have ideas that they are developing. A lot of them aren”t sure how to do that well, but you know what there is a power of synergy, and linking arms with other people who are on the same path. So if they have technology questions they ask each other. I don’t have to have all the answers, and I don’t. If they have questions about marketing they ask each other. The 48days.net is just a fun place for people to experiment as they move into new creative ideas they want to develop. The way we had a lot of resource because we would be delighted to share people on those, got a couple of books 48 days to the work you love, no more Mondays is a more recent one. It”s real popular that talks more about these creative ideas like we have talked about here. But I want to encourage people that you know just if you lose your sense of hope, you really are dead in the water. But as long as you have a sense of hope there are so many opportunities today, and I don’t want to be just some empty headed optimist, but I”m really one of these glass half full kind of guys because I just see the reality of what people were able to do out here. We are hearing from the people everyday too, and I”m thrilled to do so that we were saying that for the first time I really did tapped into my dreams and my passions. I would have never done, and I had not been confronted with this. You know I”m so grateful that I have been released to really go with my dream, and start this next season of my life you know with the sense of purpose. Jason: Well that’s fantastic. By the way can I ask you where do the name 48 days come from? Dan: You know I would like to say that it was some kind of a scientific process, but it really was more art than science, but I used to — my business used to be called the Business Source. Now if there are any three more generic oatmeal names in the world I would like to know what they are. The Business Source, nothing unique about them at all and you do a Google search and you are going to get millions. This is back when 48 hours was becoming popular as a TV show. And I thought how could I get some brand recognition if I use the 48, and I was looking for some kind of a timeline because I was becoming increasingly frustrated in working with people who are not enjoying what they were doing, we would map out a plan of action, and two years later I realized they didn”t do anything, like oh my gosh, how is this possible, so I do said we need a bit of timeline. And I believe that 48 days in enough time to access where you are. Get the advice and opinion of other people, look at what your alternative are, narrow down to the best three or four, do a little more research, choose the best one and act. Now I have really stick to that too thus if I work with somebody and we go through that process just as I described it, we really went to day 49, they haven”t done anything, that’s fine. I”m going to be your friend, but I realize you”ve made a choice. You have chosen to continue what you are doing, that’s perfectly fine. But frankly I don’t want to invest my time anymore beyond that. Well, that”s difference between a coach rather than a counselor too, but I move people through quickly coming up with creative plan for the action. I want to see new results, and I think 48 days is enough time to do that. And it”s just unique enough Jason that it gets people’s attention. It”s not something more common like 30 days or 60 days or 90 days, 48. People ask about it just like you have, and then they will get excited about the fact that you mean I really can change my life in 48 days? And my response always is yes, you can if you create a plan. Jason: Well that”s given people some hope. Dan Miller, thank you so much for joining us today. We really appreciate the inspiration. I know people are facing a lot of difficult times out there today and we want to turn them around, and help people turned lemons into lemonade, so you help people do that. Thank you so much.

            "215-731-2280 PHONE_NUMBER 3653 3665 Because it's been so long since the last PFT election, many rank and file members are unfamiliar with the process of choosing their union leadership. As a result, we've encountered a lot of questions and points of confusion that deserve a response. Read on to find out what people are saying, and whether it's true or not. Should I hand my ballot over to my Building Rep or Political Liaison? They're asking me to. We respect the efforts that people are making to ensure that voter turnout is good. However, we find it straight-up disturbing that somebody would come between you and the secure delivery of your ballot. And letting somebody fill out your ballot for you is just crazy. Why would you hand your democratic right to vote over to somebody else? Arrange a ballot fill-out and mailing party at your building, come to one of our happy hour events on Friday Feb. 5th, and feel free to show people your sealed envelope. But send it off personally, please. The bottom line: putting your ballot anywhere else but inside a USPS mailbox means it might not get delivered. Don't let anyone come between you and your vote. Will the PFT know how I voted? The answer here is an absolute NO. When you send back your ballot, you will be placing it in two envelopes: first in an anonymous ballot envelope, and then in the prepaid mailing envelope. This second, outer envelope gets scanned upon delivery. This ensures that the ballot mailbox isn't being stuffed. That envelope is then removed and discarded, leaving only your anonymous ballot. AAA will have a record of who sent in a ballot, but NOT how you voted. Unfortunately, we have had several reports of PFT members trying to intimidate voters by telling them \"the PFT is watching you and how you vote.\" If you hear that in person, please let the offender know that they are both a bully and a liar. If WE win, will everybody in the PFT offices get fired? Again, the answer here is an absolute NO. We are interested in retaining as much of the current staff as possible, especially the administrators and secretaries who have kept things running \"behind the scenes\" all these years. Think of it this way: when we elect a new President of the United States, do all government workers get the axe? Certainly not. Unfortunately, several PFT staffers have explicitly stated, even threatened, that they will quit if WE wins the election. We are troubled to think that partisan loyalties would overrule whatever sense of duty and service staffers might have to the membership. Where did the caucus get the money for this campaign? The answer: from the rank and file of the PFT, and the friends and family who care about them. Seriously -- hats off to our fundraising team, but they didn't have to go sell their souls or make a single handshake deal to secure the funds we needed. Most of it was raised in tens and twenties at the dozens of house parties, happy hours, and other events we have had. We've raised about $30,000 total, the bulk of which is being spent on our citywide mailers. Craziest rumor to dispel: No, we did not accept, nor were we offered, any donations from PSP. There is no version of the universe where that would happen. How did the caucus get my home mailing address? According to PFT election procedures, any caucus running a slate may pay to send out campaign materials to the membership, though a third party. So technically, we didn't get everybody's address -- we sent our materials to a company that mailed it for us. CB team has to do the same thing. If you haven't received a campaign mailing from WE yet, call AAA as soon as possible to confirm you are on their ballot list: 215-731-2280. People who have called were able to get immediate confirmation.\n",

We have offices located in Uniontown and Mon Valley to serve injured workers throughout southwestern Pennsylvania. Our attorneys are committed to helping injured workers get the workers' compensation benefits they deserve.

If you are injured at work you must go to a doctor on your employer's list of approved physicians. It is also important to inform your employer as soon as you have been injured, and go to the doctor for a complete examination, and accept assignments for light duty that are offered by your employer. Our attorneys have significant experience handling cases involving the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act. We can often help people get workers' compensation even if benefits have been denied. Our lawyers work closely with each client to help ensure they get the benefits they need while they recover from their injuries.

Threemile Canyon, a 55,000 cow factory farm, a few miles from the Columbia River near Boardman, about 30 miles from Hermiston, is reportedly the largest dairy in the world. The dairy seems to have flown under the radar into sparsely-populated Morrow County, where the farm sits on a bone-dry monotonous stretch of landscape, invisible to Interstate-84 travelers. The United Farm Workers document their battles with Threemile Canyon Farms and A.J. Bos. February 2003: Sixty-nine workers initiate legal action against Threemile Canyon Farms for failure to pay minimum wage, illegal deductions from their paychecks, and retaliation for organizing activities (First letter advising dairy of claims for wages). September 16, 2003: Twenty-two workers file suit against Threemile Canyon Farms for failing to pay minimum wage, illegal deductions from their paychecks and retaliation. (Alvaro Caldera Flores et. al vs. Columbia River Dairy LLC No. 030910188 Multnomah County Circuit Court, filed in Portland, Oregon). Nov. 10, 2005: Three women workers file a second lawsuit against the farm over sexual discrimination. As part of that action, attorneys file sworn affidavits from 12 current Threemile Canyon Farms employees that reveal dairy co-owner A.J.

            "870120605 US_SSN 9966 9975 Essential tremor (ET), which is one of the most common movement disorders, may lead to severe interference in quality of life. The first genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified an association of the LINGO1 variant (rs9652490) with ET in Americans and Europeans. Recently, a second GWAS that was performed in a European population has discovered a new variant (rs3794087) of the main glial glutamate transporter (SLC1A2) that increases the risk of ET with an odds ratio of about 1.4. SLC1A2 encodes for the major glial high-affinity glutamate reuptake transporter in the brain and is a potential ET susceptibility gene. Because replication in a different ethnic population is important for validating a finding, we conducted a case-control study to investigate the SLC1A2 variant in an Asian cohort with ET in Taiwan. A total of 542 subjects (273 ET patients and 269 controls) were included. The results showed that rs3794087 was associated with ET among the Taiwanese. The odds ratio was 1.37. Our results were similar to those of the second GWAS of ET in Europeans, and this confirms that SLC1A2 may be a good functional candidate gene for ET. A replication study in another independent population is of importance to validate this association. Funding: This study was sponsored by Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan (CMRPG3A0132; CMRPG331182), and National Science Council, Executive Yuan, Taiwan (NSC101-2314-B-182A-065). The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. The first genome wide association study (GWAS) for ET found an association of 2 variant sequences (rs9652490 and rs11856808) in the LINGO1 gene and ET in Europeans and Americans [6,14–16]. A second GWAS study has revealed an association between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3794087 in intron 4 of the main glial glutamate transporter (SLC1A2) gene and ET in Germans and Europeans . In order to understand genetic effects across different populations, we aimed to investigate the genetic susceptibilities of the rs1564282 SNP in SLC1A2 among the Han Chinese in Taiwan population. A total of 273 patients who were diagnosed with probable ET were enrolled. ET was diagnosed according to the Tremor Investigation Group criteria . The inclusion criteria of probable ET are the following: bilateral posture tremor with or without kinetic tremor involving the hands and forearms; tremor that is confined to body parts other than the hands; tremor duration of at least 3 years; and no other neurological deficits. A total of 296 healthy adult volunteers who were enrolled as a control group were matched to the patient group for age, gender, ethnic origin, and area of residence. All subjects gave written informed consents for the study (No 99-0896 A3) under a protocol approved by Chang Gung Medical Foundation Institutional Review Board. DNA was extracted from leukocytes with standard protocols. The prevalence of the polymorphism rs3794087, which is an intronic variant in SLC1A2, was determined with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The sequences of the primers were as follows: 5′-CTGTTGACCTAAGACGTAATGG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CCATAGGAAGCAATGCTGAAC-3′ (reverse primer). The PCR was conducted in a reaction containing 100 ng genomic DNA, 0.2 mM of each primer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 2.0 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 U Taq polymerase. The thermal cycling conditions consisted of 95° C for 4 min, which was followed by 40 cycles of 95° C for 30 s, 55.4° C for 30 s, and 72° C for 30 s. A final extension step of 72° C for 10 min was followed by a 4° C hold cycle. The amplified PCR fragments were digested with HpyCH4III (New England BioLabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA, USA) and separated on a 2.0% agarose gel. The variant (rs 3794087A) eliminate a HpyCH4III restriction site on the PCR product such that such that, upon digestion, a 442-bp fragment appeared instead of 297 and 145 bp fragments, as was the case for the wild type (rs 3794087G). Chi square tests were used to compare the frequency of the alleles and the genotypes in both cases and controls. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Statistical significance was defined as p values less than 0.05. A total of 542 subjects (273 ET patients and 269 normal controls) were included. The mean age at recruitment of the ET patients was 60.3 ± 14.5 years, and the mean age of onset of the ET symptoms was 55.3 ± 16.9 years. Of the ET patients, 47.1% were males, and 25.7% of them had a positive family history of ET. The mean age of recruitment of the 269 controls (47.9% male) was 61.2 ± 13.2 years. The frequencies of the rs3794087 genotypes and alleles of both the ET patients and controls are shown in Table 1. The SLC1A2 rs3794087 A allele showed a greater frequency in ET patients than in controls (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.02–1.86; p = 0.03). After stratifying the results according to the presence of family history, we were unable to find a stronger association in the familial ET group. This may have been due to the small sample size. Table 1. Frequency of Genotype and Allele Polymorphisms of SCL1A2 rs3794087 Among Essential Tremor (ET) and Controls in Taiwan. All p-values were calculated by means of chi-squared test. The first stage of the second GWAS revealed an association between the rs3794087 SNP in intron 4 of the SLC1A2 gene and ET in a German population, and the authors then collected verification samples that included 3 populations (German, Austrian, and Danish origin) in Europe for the second stage of the study. The rs3794087 SNP yielded an OR of 1.43 with a nominal p of 1.16 × 10-7 in the combined first- and second-stage samples . Later, Tan et al has reported that the frequency of MAF was lower in ET compared with controls (15% vs 19.5%, OR=0.75, 95% CI 0.60–0.94, p= 0.009) in Singapore’s cohort , which was different from the GWAS and our results. Our study found association with the same allele as in the GWAS for ET. The minor allele displayed an OR of 1.37 (p = 0.03; 95% CI, 1.02–1.86). Our results confirmed the finding of GWAS that rs3794087 is a risk variant of ET. The function of this noncoding SNP is still unknown. The SLC1A2 gene encodes for the glutamate reuptake transporter. Increased olivary glucose utilization and blood flow in the cerebellum, red nucleus, and thalamus on both sides have been found in positron emission tomography studies of patients with ET . The SLC1A2 gene is strongly expressed in the inferior olive but not in other structures of the brainstem. In addition, ethanol may increase SLC1A2 expression and glutamate reuptake activity and significantly reduce tremor in many ET patients [17,19,20]. This study focused on Taiwanese subjects, which definitely have a more homogenous genetic background than Caucasians from different origins. The sample size of our case-control study was modest. There were some limitations of our study. First, only one SNP was analyzed, and it did not exclude an association between other regions within or around the gene. Thus, further investigations, such as whole gene sequencing, should be done to clarify the role of SLC1A2 in ET. Second, the roles of other genes, gene-environmental interactions, or epigenetic factors have not been evaluated, and these could be confounding variables. Third, there is a different result from another independent Asian cohorts , the significance that we observed would likely be more reliable if we were able to perform a meta-analysis across different cohorts. In conclusion, this is the first report to show association with the same allele as in the GWAS for ET in a Chinese group. We conclude that the SLC1A2 rs3794087 variant contributed to the risk of ET in Taiwan. Further studies in other populations will be useful to validate our finding.

            "201800060 US_SSN 2429 2438 Thomas Bosch What Can the Origins of Multicellular Life Teach Us About How Bodies Function? Professor Thomas Bosch is Director of the Kiel Life Science (KLS) Interdisciplinary Research Center at Kiel University. A Senior Fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR), Bosch also leads the German Science Foundation’s “Origin and Function of Metaorganisms” Collaborative Research Center. His research interests include the individual as metaorganism, stem cells and ageing and evolutionary immunology. Editor in Chief of Zoology, Bosch was awarded an honorary doctorate from St. Petersburg State University in 2004. - DFG Normalverfahren Sachbeihilfe (Bo 848/17-2) (2014-2017) “Epitheliale Abwehr in Hydra\" From protists to humans, all animals and plants are inhabited by microbial organisms. There is an increasing appreciation that these resident microbes influence fitness of their plant and animal hosts, ultimately forming a metaorganism consisting of a uni- or multicellular host and a community of associated microorganisms. Research on host-microbe interactions has become an emerging cross-disciplinary field. In both vertebrates as well as invertebrates a complex microbiome confers immunological, metabolic and behavioural benefits; its disturbance can contribute to the development of disease states. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling interactions within the metaorganisms are poorly understood and many key interactions between the associated organisms remain unknown. Multicellular organisms first took their place in the evolutionary chain some 450 million years ago. In this video, THOMAS BOSCH seeks to extend our understanding of how human and animal bodies function via analysis of these ancient creatures. Focusing on the freshwater polyp Hydra and employing techniques including molecular cell biology, modern sequencing technology and in depth study of stem cell behavior, Bosch argues that what were heretofore considered ancient simple creatures, are, in fact, decidedly complex. Providing important new insight into the microbial world, Bosch’s work underlines the fact that all life is multiorganismic, raising fundamental philosophical questions about how we define individuality.

School of Nursing, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb 60115-2894, USA. To identify factors that may influence parenting by mothers who are recovering from cocaine addiction. Exploratory descriptive, with in-depth unstructured interviews. Interviews were conducted in the woman's home or in a treatment center. A convenience sample of 11 women recovering from cocaine addiction who were mothers of children 3 years of age and younger. A content analysis was used to analyze the interview data. Two themes, personal/psychologic factors and environmental/contextual factors, and four subthemes emerged. They identify issues that may affect parenting by mothers being treated for cocaine addiction. Subthemes included low self-esteem, difficulty developing a maternal identity, isolation from friends and family, and chronic life stress. This study provides a better understanding of the sources contributing to vulnerability in the parenting role for mothers recovering from cocaine addiction and will assist nurses in providing care for these mothers and their children.\n",

            "18974-5376 US_SSN 774 784 1. This is an action for damages brought by an individual consumer, against Defendants Trans Union, LLC and Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC for violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681, et seq. 2. Plaintiff is an adult individual residing in New Smyrna Beach, Florida. 3. Defendant, Trans Union, LLC (“Trans Union”), is a consumer reporting agency that regularly conducts business in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and which has a principal place of business located at 1510 Chester Pike, Crum Lynne, PA 19022. 4. Defendant Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (“Ocwen”) is a business entity which regularly conducts business in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and which has a principal place of business located at 365 Newtown Road, Warminster, PA 18974-5376. 5. Jurisdiction of this Court arises under 15 U.S.C. § 1681p and 28 U.S.C. § 1331. 6. Venue lies properly in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). 7. Defendant has been reporting derogatory and inaccurate statements and information relating to Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s credit history to third parties (“inaccurate information”) from at least March 2012 through present. The inaccurate information pertains to a mortgage loan with Ocwen. 8. Specifically, the Ocwen account is reporting as included in “bankruptcy” on Plaintiff’s Trans Union credit report, despite the fact that no public record of bankruptcy appears on Plaintiff’s consumer reports. The Ocwen account was never included in bankruptcy, nor discharged through bankruptcy. Ocwen furnished this inaccurate information to Trans Union at least through March 2012 and thereafter. Trans Union and Ocwen each investigated and/or reinvestigated the inaccurate information following disputes by Plaintiff and each failed to delete or correct the inaccurate information. 9. The inaccurate information negatively reflects upon Plaintiff, Plaintiff’s credit repayment history, Plaintiff’s financial responsibility as a debtor and Plaintiff’s creditworthiness. 10. Defendants have been reporting the inaccurate information through the issuance of false and inaccurate credit information and consumer credit reports that they have disseminated to various persons and credit grantors, both known and unknown. Defendant has repeatedly published and disseminated consumer reports to such third parties from at least March 2012 through the present. 11. Plaintiff has disputed the inaccurate information with Defendants by following Trans Union’s established procedures for disputing consumer credit information. 12. Plaintiff has disputed the inaccurate information with Trans Union from April 2012 through the present. 13. Notwithstanding Plaintiff’s efforts, Trans Union has sent Plaintiff correspondence indicating its intent to continue publishing the inaccurate information and Trans Union continues to publish and disseminate such inaccurate information to other third parties, persons, entities and credit grantors. Trans Union has repeatedly published and disseminated consumer reports to such third parties from at least March 2012 through the present. 14. Despite Plaintiff’s efforts, Trans Union has never: (1) contacted Plaintiff to follow up on, verify and/or elicit more specific information about Plaintiff’s disputes; (2) contacted any third parties that would have relevant information concerning Plaintiff’s disputes; (3) forwarded all relevant information concerning Plaintiff’s disputes to the entities originally furnishing the inaccurate information; and (4) requested or obtained any credit applications, or other relevant documents, such as bankruptcy court documents. 15. Notwithstanding Plaintiff’s disputes, Ocwen has also failed to conduct timely and reasonable investigations of Plaintiff’s disputes after being contacted by the relevant credit reporting agencies concerning Plaintiff’s disputes, on or about April 2012, and upon Ocwen’s conclusion of an ineffective investigation, it has willfully continued to report such inaccurate information to various credit reporting agencies, and has failed to mark the above accounts as disputed. 16. Despite Plaintiff’s exhaustive efforts to date, Defendants have nonetheless deliberately, willfully, intentionally, recklessly and negligently repeatedly failed to perform reasonable reinvestigations and/or investigations of the above disputes as required by the FCRA, have failed to remove the inaccurate information, have failed to note the disputed status of the inaccurate information and have continued to report the derogatory inaccurate information about the Plaintiff. 17. As of result of Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiff has suffered actual damages in the form of lost credit opportunities, harm to credit reputation and credit score, and emotional distress. 18. At all times pertinent hereto, Defendants were acting by and through their agents, servants and/or employees who were acting within the course and scope of their agency or employment, and under the direct supervision and control of the Defendants herein. 19. At all times pertinent hereto, the conduct of the Defendants, as well as that of their agents, servants and/or employees, was intentional, willful, reckless, and in grossly negligent disregard for federal laws and the rights of the Plaintiff herein. 20. Plaintiff incorporates the foregoing paragraphs as though the same were set forth at length herein. 21. At all times pertinent hereto, Trans Union was a “person” and a “consumer reporting agency” as those terms are defined by 15 U.S.C. § 1681a(b) and (f). 22. At all times pertinent hereto, Plaintiff was a “consumer” as that term is defined by 15 U.S.C. § 1681a(c). 23. At all times pertinent hereto, the above-mentioned credit reports were “consumer reports” as that term is defined by 15 U.S.C. § 1681a(d). 24. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §1681n and 15 U.S.C. §1681o, Trans Union is liable to the Plaintiff for willfully and negligently failing to comply with the requirements imposed on a consumer reporting agency of information pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681e(b) and 1681i. 25. The conduct of Trans Union was a direct and proximate cause, as well as a substantial factor, in bringing about the serious injuries, actual damages and harm to Plaintiff that are outlined more fully above and, as a result, Trans Union is liable to Plaintiff for the full amount of statutory, actual and punitive damages, along with the attorney’s fees and the costs of litigation, as well as such further relief, as may be permitted by law. 26. Plaintiff incorporates the foregoing paragraphs as though the same were set forth at length herein. 27. At all times pertinent hereto Ocwen was a “person” as that term defined by 15 U.S.C. § 1681a(b). 28. At all times pertinent hereto Ocwen was a “furnisher of credit information” as contemplated by 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(b). 29. Ocwen violated sections 1681n and 1681o of the FCRA by willfully and negligently failing to comply with the requirements imposed on furnishers of information pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(b). 30. Ocwen’s conduct was a direct and proximate cause, as well as a substantial factor, in causing the serious injuries, damages and harm to the Plaintiff that are outlined more fully above, and as a result Ocwen is liable to compensate Plaintiff for the full amount of statutory, actual and punitive damages, along with attorney’s fees and costs, as well as such other relief, permitted by law. 31. Plaintiff demands trial by jury on all issues so triable.\n",

            "737-30-1070 US_SSN 4950 4961 13 Aug 2016 - The UK Air Accident Investigation Board AAIB have issued their final reports into two similar erroneous airspeed and altitude events to 737-800s EI-FHG and EI-DWS on 8th and 9th Jan 2016 during descent into the UK in icing conditions. The cause in both cases was a failure of the pitot probe heating element. Conclusion The erroneous airspeed and altitude indication was likely to have been caused by partial and transient ice blockage of the first officers / commander’s* pitot probe whilst in light / light to moderate** icing conditions. This was as a result of the failure of the pitot probe heating element. The partial icing conclusion is supported by the fact that the blockage alleviated itself in the descent when the IAS and ALT information returned to normal. The aircraft was on approach to London Gatwick when the crew was presented with erroneous airspeed and altitude information on one of the two cockpit display systems. The crew took appropriate ‘IAS Disagree, ALT Disagree and Airspeed Unreliable’ actions in accordance with the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). In the final stage of the approach the airspeed and altitude returned to normal and the aircraft landed without further incident. Subsequent diagnosis found the right (first officer’s) pitot probe to have a fault with its ice and rain protection heating element. Ordinarily this would not have affected the operation of the probe but the aircraft had encountered light icing conditions during its descent. Without the protection afforded by the pitot heater, it is likely that an ice restriction developed within the tube, corrupting pitot pressure data fed into the aircraft system. About the time of the incident the commander noted they had entered light icing conditions observing the effect on the windscreen. When the ‘IAS and ALT disagree’ caution illuminated he concluded the cause to be a frozen pitot probe or static port. The aircraft responses to the various actions taken by the crew confirmed that a blockage within the first officer’s pitot probe was the probable cause. Although the airspeed and altitude information was unreliable, there was not a complete loss of information which suggests only a partial blockage of the probe which alleviated as the aircraft continued its descent. The operator carried out fault diagnosis on the pitot-static system and found the first officer’s pitot heater resistance to be out of limits. The probe, Part No 0851HT, had accrued 20,232 hours and 11,526 cycles. During this incident, as with previous similar events, there was no indication of pitot probe malfunction on the window/pitot heat panel. The aircraft manufacturer had issued Service Bulletin (SB) 737-30-1070 in April 2014 which introduced a minor modification to the pitot probe heater wiring. The modification ensures that in the event of a pitot heater malfunction, a master caution will appear in the cockpit. The Service Bulletin compliance is at the Operator’s discretion and in this case the modification is under consideration. The full report for EI-FHG is available here. The aircraft was descending towards Liverpool Airport when the crew was presented with erroneous airspeed and altitude information on one of the two cockpit display systems. The crew took appropriate ‘Airspeed and Altitude Unreliable’ actions in accordance with the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). In the later stages of the descent the airspeed and altitude returned to normal and the aircraft landed without further incident. Subsequent diagnosis found the left (commander’s) pitot probe to have a fault with its ice and rain protection heating element. Ordinarily this would not have affected the operation of the probe but the aircraft had encountered light to moderate icing conditions during its descent. Without the protection afforded by the pitot heater, it is likely that an ice restriction developed within the tube thus corrupting pitot pressure data fed into the aircraft system. During the incident the commander noted that the symptoms appeared to indicate some form of blockage or restriction to his pitot probe thereby corrupting pitot information into the air data system. Icing was considered the plausible cause given the atmospheric conditions. Although the airspeed and altitude information was unreliable, there was not a complete loss of information which suggests only a partial blockage of the probe which alleviated as the aircraft continued its descent. Subsequent fault diagnosis carried out by the operator found that the commander’s (left side) pitot probe heater element had shorted to its casing. The item was replaced and the aircraft returned to service. The probe, Part No 0851HT, had accrued 17,864 hours and 10,385 cycles. During this incident, as with previous similar events, there was no indication of pitot probe malfunction on the window/pitot heat panel. The aircraft manufacturer had issued Service Bulletin (SB) 737-30-1070 in April 2014 which introduced a minor modification to the pitot probe heater wiring. The modification ensures that in the event of a pitot heater malfunction, a master caution will appear in the cockpit. The SB compliance is at the Operator’s discretion and in this case the Operator had scheduled it for this aircraft’s next deep maintenance package. The full report for EI-DWS is available here.\n",

            "194083567 US_SSN 2315 2324 Elton John, King of Pop? Growing up, Elton John was a common name in my household while growing up and so made an easy, but interesting subject to search in both databases. Elton John, 1974 North American Tour. Elton John (left) and Bernie Taupin (right). professionally in 1965 when acquired work opening for American artists. However, soon after Reginald was looking for more control in his performing life. He auditions for the groups King Crimson and Gentle Giant. And it was around this time that he started communicating with composer Bernie Taupin. It was during their initial communications that Reginald switched his name to Elton John. This pair is what eventually led John to his success that began in 1970 with the release of Johns second album titled Elton John. Now why give John the title of Kong of Pop when it has been considered Michael Jackson’s for so long (I am, in no way trying to diminish Jackson’s influence or importance, only acknowledge someone else)? In part it is due to his success listed above, but it is also due to his theatrical stage presence in all of his concerts, his eccentric and flamboyant attitude, as well as his current position within pop culture. Alongside Rolling Stones and The Beatles, he is one of the top-selling British Artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. And still performing today, he is a testament to the growth and development of pop culture. Another reason I find that John could be considered another King of Pop is because of the style of his music. In the same article linked above, John and Taupin’s music is described as “[looking] longingly back to an older America of Country Gospel songs… and of headliners of the thirties, fours, and fifties.” This musical connection to the past makes his music very accessible to older generations, the lyrics connect primarily with people of his and younger generations, and lastly his costumes, in ways, pay tribute to the flair of early musicals. All in all, John’s stage presence, his music, and Taupin’s lyrics create a unique repertoire within the standards of Pop music that, like many of the great “classical” composers, have become timeless to me. “Elton Looks Back in Time.” 1975.Chicago Defender (Big Weekend Edition) (1973-1975), Aug 02, 1. https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.stolaf.edu/docview/194083567?accountid=351.

Dunton, Jr. Somerset, Mass., where she had been residing for the last 18 months. Marge was born April 25, 1924 in Somerville to Maurice and Mary (O�Brien) Hurley. She graduated from Somerville High School in 1942 and Rutgers Institute of Alcoholic Studies. She married Edwin C. Dunton, Sr. in 1943 with whom she had her only child, Ed Jr. Subsequently, she was married to Dr. Alvah Reida (deceased 1975), Joseph McMahon and Clarence Jackson (deceased 1985). She started her own local newspaper, the Hampden Observer in Hampden, Maine in the 1940�s. She held a variety of employment during the 1940�s and 1950�s to include the companies of Raytheon, St. Johnsbury Trucking and Pepsi-Cola until she found her true calling in life, helping others to help themselves. In 1960, with a $2,500 loan from her mother, Marge (a friend of Bill W.�s since 1957) founded Naukeag Hospital in Ashburnham. Her goal was to provide alcoholics a place to be listened to and understood as individuals with unique problems and needs. Marge and her staff at Naukeag gave them that opportunity. Over the next 25 years, Naukeag Hospital was one of those magical places where all the right things come together at just the right time to help first dozens of people, then hundreds of people, then thousands of people. This help came with their sobriety and a new beginning through being hospitalized at Naukeag and participating in the program it provided. She retired from Naukeag in 1982. Marge was a much sought after speaker in Alcoholics Anonymous around the country. In fact, she was a featured speaker at Bill W.�s 50th Anniversary. She also addressed many groups of healthcare professionals and addiction specialists. She was an avid traveler to many parts of the world and especially enjoyed her trips to the Middle and Far East. She is survived by her son, Dr. Edwin C. Dunton, Jr. and his wife Jodiann (Somerset); her granddaughter, Dr. Theresa A. Dunton and her husband Gary McGonagill (Big Stone Gap, VA); three great-granddaughters, Mollie, Maeve and Millie� ten step-children and two step-grandchildren, Tabetha and Melinda. She was preceded in death by her parents; husbands, Edwin, Alvah and Clarence; sisters, Mary, Anna, Emma and Rita and her grandson, Tedi. There are no calling hours. A graveside memorial service will be held on August 4th at 11 a.m. at Oak Ridge Cemetery, Route 134, S. Dennis, Mass. to be followed by a reception in celebration of her life at the home of her niece, Andrea Campbell, 280 Trotting Park Rd., West Dennis, Mass. In lieu of flowers, the family request donations be made to The Marge - Dunton-Reida Naukeag Patient Fund. Please mail donations to McLean Hospital, 115 Mill St., Belmont St., Belmont, MA 02478-9106 To the attention of Jay Livingstone.

Advanced Synthesis & Catalysis , 354 (17) 3217 - 3224. 10.1002/adsc.201200491. In the presence of a cationic gold(I) catalyst and N-halosuccinimide, both trimethylsilyl-protected and terminal alkynes are converted into alkynyl halides. Further experiments showed that silyl-protected alkynes undergo electrophilic iodination and bromination under Brønsted acid catalysis, whilst terminal alkynes require a cationic gold catalyst. The former reactions probably proceed via activation of the electrophile, whilst the latter reactions proceed via a gold(I) acetylide intermediate. Gold-catalysed halogenation was further combined with gold-catalysed hydration and subsequent annulation to provide convenient routes to iodomethyl ketones and five-membered aromatic heterocycles.\n",

PHUKET: This year’s Phuket Heroines’ Festival will feature the acting debut of Phuket governor Tri Augkaradacha, who will take center stage in the role of King Rama I in a historical drama based on the history of Thalang. The 2011 installment of the annual event will take place March 13 to 15 at Thalang Victory Memorial Field in Thepkrasattri subdistrict. The festival, officially entitled the Thao Thepkrasattri – Thao Srisunthorn Commemmoration Fetival 2011, is organized jointly by the Phuket Provincial Administration Organization (OrBorJor) and Phuket Cultural Office. It is intended to increase awareness of local history and culture among Thai citizens. “I will portray King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke (Rama I). I am honored to have been invited to take this role. I will give my best possible performance,” Gov Tri said. The cast comprises some 1,000 people including students, local residents and people from both the private and government sectors, he said. The 12-act production is scheduled to run for about one-and-a-half hours. “The scenes will be more realistic than in performances in previous years,” he promised. “My wish is that this drama will make the audience love their nation and learn about its history at the same time,” Dr Sawit added. Also to that effect, the Culture Office will offer historical tours of Thalang on March 8 to 10 in the run-up to the festival. Two buses with 40 passengers each will set out from Provincial Hall at 9am to visit six important sites in the district: Thalang National Museum, Phra Nang Sang Temple, Phra Thong Temple, Baan Thao Thep, Muang Komarapaj Temple and Thalang Victory Memorial. The tours will end back at Provincial Hall at 4pm. Admission is free of charge. Those interested can reserve seats by calling the Culture Office at 076-223617 or 076-223654. 9pm – midnight: Thai arts and cultural performances. Unless otherwise specified, all events will be held at Thalang Victory Memorial Field, located across from the wet market and Thalang Witthaya School on Dom Chom Tao Road (Route 4030) in Thepkrasattri subdistrict, near the intersection with Thepkrasattri Road (Route 402). Burmese troops build a camp at Khok Chana Pama and prepare for assault Thalang. Lady Jan , Lady Mook and Department of Town Planning set a camp and cannons to counterattack the Burmese troops. The plan was to slow the troops down and to shorten their foods supplies as much as possible, in order to lure the Burmese troops. Thai woman were dressed in solder uniforms withtin-toated sward made from coral wood. This was purposely to set a scene pretending Thalang had more soldiers' fillings in a camp during the night.

Animal disease traceability, or knowing where diseased and at-risk animals are, where they've been, and when, is very important to ensure there can be a rapid response when animal disease events take place. An efficient and accurate animal disease traceability system helps reduce the number of animals involved in an investigation, reduces the time needed to respond, and decreases the cost to producers and the government.

            "55155-4194 US_SSN 2214 2224 Public comments are due by Dec. 4 on a plan to reduce pollution in the St. Croix River tributary. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) and local partner groups have developed a plan to restore and protect water quality in the Goose Creek watershed. Goose Creek watershed, located north of the Twin Cities metropolitan area, includes portions of Chisago and Pine counties. The Goose Creek Watershed Restoration and Protection Strategy (WRAPS) report and Goose Creek Watershed Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) report are available for public review through Dec. 4, 2015. Water quality monitoring and analysis has shown that high levels of bacteria and phosphorus are present in many water bodies within the Goose Creek watershed. The TMDL report quantifies the pollutant levels, identifies the sources of the pollution, and proposes ways to bring water quality back to an acceptable level. The WRAPS report identifies impaired water bodies and those in need of protection, and recommends steps needed to achieve and maintain water quality. For example, to reduce the amount of nutrients such as phosphorus in the watershed, stream buffers must be re-established along the lakes, streams, and ditches to reduce runoff, and the amount of phosphorus runoff from agricultural and rural lands must be reduced. Many groups are participating in restoration and protection efforts, including the Chisago County Soil Water Conservation District, Pine County Soil and Water Conservation District, Chisago County, local governments, lake associations, and several state agencies. Individuals are always encouraged to get involved. This report is one of just a handful completed under the state’s watershed approach, a holistic way of gauging the health of streams and lakes, and developing strategies to restore or protect their water quality. The MPCA encourages those interested in the Goose Creek Watershed to review and provide feedback on the reports, which are available online. The reports are posted on the Goose Creek watershed web page at http://www.pca.state.mn.us/hh89xpd. Comments on the reports should be submitted in writing by Dec. 4, 2015, to Christopher Klucas, 520 Lafayette Road North, St. Paul, MN 55155-4194, or christopher.klucas@state.mn.us. Klucas is available to answer questions at 651-757-2498. Written comments must specify which report you are commenting on, and should include a statement of your interest in the report and the action you wish the MPCA to take, including specific references to sections of the draft report you believe should be changed. You must state the specific reasons for your position. More information is available on the MPCA’s Impaired waters and TMDLs webpage.\n",

            "201202210 US_SSN 13035 13044 Let’s start with some…real science. For a real detailed explanation of the science of sugars, specifically HFCS, I wrote about it in excruciating detail elsewhere. Really, read about the science of sugars, it’s important to this story. I’ll summarize here. There are over 20 naturally occurring simple sugars, called monosaccharides, found on this planet. All but four have any significant role in human nutrition: glucose, fructose, galactose, and ribose. Those are the only four sugars that can be absorbed by the gut and used by the human body. But things never are that simple. Many sugars we consume are disaccharides, or two simple sugars bound together. For example, table sugar is sucrose, a disaccharide made of one molecule of glucose bound to one molecule of fructose. When you consume sucrose, it is broken down rather easily into one molecule of fructose and one molecule of glucose, before your body can absorb it. This is not complicated, and it’s not anything magical, it just how it is. Sucrose has a unique taste that is found in brown sugar, molasses, beet sugar, and maple syrup–lots of places. In each of those, the sucrose is the same, and other “contaminants” give it different flavors, like the different “chemicals” that give maple its flavor. There are other common disaccharides that we eat, like lactose or milk sugar, which is glucose and galactose; maltose which is two glucose molecules; and a few dozen less common ones. Each disaccharide has a slightly different taste profile in pure form, and some rare disaccharides provide unique tastes to certain fruits and vegetables. But when these disaccharides enter the intestinal tract, they are quickly disassociated by water or acids plus enzymes into simple monosaccharides. To the body, whatever type of sugar you consume, in whatever form, and in whatever food, to be absorbed, it must be broken down to glucose, fructose, galactose, and very rarely, ribose. Therefore, if you read some bogus pseudoscience that this sugar or that sugar is better or worse for you, they all break down into simple monosaccharides, only four, just four, matter to human health. And the chemical structure of glucose, fructose, galactose, and ribose are exactly the same if they are in a pear, a bag of white sugar, manufactured in a chemical factory, or lovingly harvested from the nectar of a rare flower growing the headwaters of the Amazon. Like I said, all monosaccharides and disaccharides have different flavors from the human perspective. And they have different sweetness. For example, fructose is 1.73 times more sweet than sucrose despite having the same exact caloric content. So technically, you could use about 58% less fructose than sucrose to get the same sweetness. Yes, you read that right, fructose is so much sweeter than other sugars, less can be used to attain the same sweetness level. And fructose is a 100% “natural” chemical. Then what is high fructose corn syrup? HFCS consists of 24% water, and the rest fructose and glucose–the water just makes the fructose and glucose, no different than any other fructose and glucose on the planet, into a syrup. The difference between HFCS and table sugar, which is also fructose and glucose, is that because the chemical bond between fructose and glucose in the sucrose molecule is broken by the water in HFCS, and more fructose can be added to the syrup, something that cannot be done with sucrose. And because there’s more fructose, it’s sweeter, so less sugar can be used in the manufacturing of sweet foods. People think that HFCS is some new invention that has been destroying our food just for the last few years only. But that’s simply not true. In the 1950’s, an earlier version of HFCS, called invert sugar, was used to make candy and soda manufacturers to get more sweetness by using less sugar. It’s ironic that people who claim that sugary drinks of some mythical bygone era also used HFCS, it’s just that it wasn’t known by that name. Unless you were drinking Coke and Pepsi in the 1940’s, the taste difference is nothing more than a propaganda placebo. So why was HFCS developed? But here’s the most important point: HFCS allowed food manufacturers to use less sugar — and thus fewer calories — in their products without reducing its sweetness. Now, I’m not going to believe that food manufacturers are doing this to make their foods healthy. They’re doing it for one reason–cost reduction. But natural sugars are better!!! Apples: over 10% sugar, 57% fructose, 23% glucose and 20% sucrose. Very high fructose. Peaches: 8.4% sugar, 57% sucrose, 23% glucose and 18% fructose. Pears: 9.8% sugar, 64% fructose, 28% glucose and 8% sucrose. Grapes: 15% sugar, with the sugars being 53% fructose and 47% glucose. In other words, some of these “natural” foods have as high, or, in the case of apples, peaches and pears, even higher levels of fructose than HFCS. Remember, fructose is fructose. There is no chemical difference between the fructose created by plants or created by corn. It’s the same exact fructose molecule. The body thinks it’s the same. The body metabolizes it in the same way. To any organism in the world that can metabolize fructose (I don’t know if there are any that can’t, but I’m not sure), fructose is fructose is fructose is fructose. I hope that’s clear. There is simply no difference between the fructose and glucose in HFCS, and the fructose and glucose in table sugar. The chemical formulas are exactly the same. It’s the exact same carbons, the exact same hydrogens, and the exact same oxygens. No difference. It does not matter where you find the fructose or glucose, they’re all the same. Let’s go to some real medicine. Even though there really is simply little difference between various sugars that are eaten by humans, even though “high fructose” is sweeter and therefore less sugar is used, and even though all fructose is exactly the same, there is a continuing fear about fructose. Somehow, fructose is evil. It’s dangerous. It kills. Health implications of fructose consumption: A review of recent data–”A moderate dose (≤ 50g/day) of added fructose has no deleterious effect on fasting and postprandial triglycerides, glucose control and insulin resistance. There is no existing evidence for a relation between moderate fructose consumption and hypertension. Fructose may induce hyperuricaemia, but mainly in patients with gout.” In other words, eating moderate amounts of fructose have no ill-effects. The issue remains that if you eat too much fructose (and any other sugar), there are deleterious metabolic effects, and that should be the major issue. Evidence-based review on the effect of normal dietary consumption of fructose on development of hyperlipidemia and obesity in healthy, normal weight individuals–” The results of the analysis indicate that fructose does not cause biologically relevant changes in TG (triglycerides) or body weight when consumed at levels approaching 95th percentile estimates of intake. So, there really is nothing there. Based on these meta reviews, the scientific community is coming to a consensus that HFCS is fairly safe. Now, don’t misinterpret this data. It doesn’t mean you can go drink a liter of pure HFCS every day and have no consequences. Because there are. As I’ve written before, no not really, HFCS is not correlated to diabetes. Some people have speculated that there could be a link between HFCS and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a metabolic disorder generally thought to be caused by lifestyle issues such as obesity. As some background, the basic monosaccharides, galactose, fructose, and glucose, are each metabolized in a different pathway by humans. Glucose is processed through the liver, but remains unchanged, and is used by all cells in the body for energy purposes. The level of glucose is controlled by the hormone insulin, which induces cells to store glucose if blood levels get high, and glucagon, another hormone critical to blood glucose levels, is released when blood sugar levels drop, inducing cells to glucose from storage. This control system is highly complicated, and as long as an individual is not diabetic, the blood glucose level remains finely tuned over 24 hours. It’s actually an amazing system, with highly interesting evolutionary history. Nearly the same insulin floating in our body can be found in the simplest animals, including insects and crustaceans. On the other hand, fructose and galactose don’t signal insulin. However, those two sugars are captured by the liver, eventually converted into a couple of different biochemicals, one of which is glucose. See this is an extraordinary complex system, which people oversimplify. Because fructose is metabolized differently, there has been some speculation that fructose might be implicated in T2DM. Except, there are some problems with this view linking fructose and T2DM. For example, fructose has a very low glycemic index of 19 ± 2, compared with 100 for glucose and 68 ± 5 for sucrose. Because fructose is 1.73X sweeter than sucrose, diabetics can consume significantly less fructose (than other forms of sugars) for an equivalent level of sweetness. Studies show that fructose consumed before a meal may even lessen the glycemic response of the meal. In other words, specifically because of the sweetness and lower insulin reactivity, fructose may actually be preferred for those who are attempting a low glycemic index diet. Now, I am oversimplifying how all of these sugars interact in human physiology. It would take a 1000 page book to scratch the surface. However, there is just not any convincing and plausible evidence that shows fructose, as opposed to all other monosaccharides, has some specific and unique effect on human metabolism. High quality meta reviews of the research into any correlation between HFCS and T2DM or other metabolic conditions have consistently have shown no consistent and clinically significant relationship between the consumption of fructose and any metabolic disease. We could cherry pick a few poorly designed epidemiological studies, but they don’t provide us with convincing evidence of a link. We do have evidence that any sugar can lead to obesity, whether it’s from maple syrup, HFCS, table sugar, or your local ice cream shop. So the Food Babe is wrong? About beer she is. HFCS in your beer is not going to do anything. Maybe if you’re some aficionado, and can tell me, through blind testing, that an HFCS containing beer tastes differently than a non-HFCS, I could accept that (though probably not, because I think blind tastings are bogus). And I guess there could be some flavor difference. As far as I can tell, the Food Babe gets upset about any strange chemical name, because, she lacks an education in chemical names and what they are and they aren’t. She recently had a fit about Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte, based on her arrogant and ignorant understanding of “chemicals.” She thinks that every chemical is horrible, yet our world is made of nothing BUT chemicals. If she really wanted to do this, why doesn’t she analyze all of the chemicals in coffee itself! Hey it contains a crystalline xanthine alkaloid, methyltheobromine. The Food Babe is simply inventing things as she writes, just to get hits and to feed what appears to be her enormous ego. Maybe she does have a useful message that drinking a kale smoothie is better and cheaper than a Starbucks’ drink, but it should be about the calories or cost, not about some mysterious chemical. The Food Babe is solidly unknowledgeable about actual physiological effects of these chemicals. As for beer, I never check labels. I know if it tastes good or not, based on my previous experience. And I don’t like warm beer. Who cares if it contains HFCS, unless it made it taste terrible. Then we should protest. Nevertheless, it probably will still taste better than a kale smoothie. Some beers contain high fructose corn syrup, according to the Food Babe. High fructose corn syrup is just two simple sugars connected together in water. All of its components are the same carbons, hydrogens, and oxygen atoms that are found everywhere in nature. The fructose and glucose components of HFCS are exactly the same as all other fructose and glucose in nature. HFCS probably has no effect on metabolic diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes, no more than any other sugar or foods. The Food Babe is wrong. Dolan LC, Potter SM, Burdock GA.

            "environment@st-andrews.ac.uk EMAIL_ADDRESS 25186 25214 Welcome to Anya Kaufman, our new Sustainability Intern! She’ll be working with our dedicated Environment Team who work to fulfil the University’s sustainability agenda. Anya graduated from the University of St Andrews this June with a degree in Sustainable Development. While a student Anya helped to revitalise the Sustainable Development Society and was the society President for two years. She plans on using this experience as well as the knowledge she gained from her course to continue working on projects fostered by previous Sustainability Interns, and starting some of her own! Much of Anya’s role will be focusing on outreach and engagement with students, staff, and the wider community. You’ll see her working with student societies and Transition at different events such as the Green Fayre, Green Week, and the Fairtrade Fortnight. She’ll also be heavily involved with the Environmental Hall Reps and Environmental Facilitators Network. If you want to get involved with any of those projects or really anything that involves the environment team, please send Anya a message at ak246@st-andrews.ac.uk. She’s always keen to hear about new ideas to improve the university’s level of sustainability from reducing the use of disposable coffee cups to conducting interdisciplinary sustainability research. We often don’t think about where our food comes from, and even if we do, it can be hard to know what we’re looking for. We’ve all been there, running around the supermarket getting distracted by the special offers and forgetting what we even came in for. But it’s important for us to take a minute just to reflect on what we are actually doing. Are we buying sustainable, fairly traded food? Or are we buying non-organic produce, and sending most of it off to landfill? Well fear not, because here are a few tips on how to make sure that the food on your plate is as sustainable as can be. The first thing is Fairtrade and ethical food. There are a lot of different labels, and claims of fairly traded food, but we need to know what they actually mean. Fairtrade food has the well-known label on the packaging: the Fairtrade Mark. It applies to the specific product being sold, and the fairtrade premium you pay goes to disadvantaged workers who are often from developing countries. Fairly traded often means the products are produced ethically and workers are treated well, however the producers are small-scale and can’t afford the fairtrade certification. Even better is to try and buy direct-trade products – meaning the company (e.g. a coffee or a chocolate brand) works directly with the coffee and cocoa producers, cutting out the middle man and providing better value for farmers and workers. Ethical, fairly traded and direct trade food has no universal label, so it can be hard to spot, but is still important to know about. It is focused on protecting workers’ rights throughout a company, instead of just the specific product. So why should we worry about this? It’s important to ensure the food we buy and enjoy does not come at the cost of other people’s suffering and all it takes is a check of the label for the Fairtrade mark. The next thing to consider is organic food. To be labelled organic, 95% of the ingredients in the food product must be from organically produced plants or animals. This means that it must be produced without the use of synthetic fertilisers, pesticides, animal feed additives or growth regulators. It also rules out most genetically modified foods. This is important to consider for two main reasons. The first is that they are better for your health, with more nutrients and less artificial chemicals. The second is that they are much better for livestock and for the environment, causing a significantly lower environmental impact than non-organic equivalents. So a quick glance at the label to spot the word organic can help you and the environment! Of all the food that you eat, meat and dairy have the most significant carbon footprint. Eating meat can worsen your health, contributing a lot to ageing. It also has a very harmful effect on the environment, not least because of the land that needs to be deforested to keep the livestock on. The amount of animal feed that needs to be produced is also a huge burden. And it’s expensive to buy meat! Even if you don’t want to give up all your meat to become vegetarian, or even become vegan, simply cutting down on the amount of animal-based protein you eat, buying animal welfare-certified meats such as Red Tractor, and opting for local butchers over big chains can still have a great impact. But what about the actual foods we choose to buy? Buying vegetarian and vegan options is much better for the environment, but we can still be a little bit careful with our choices. The less processed the food, the more natural and, therefore, the better for the environment it is. Probably the most important thing to consider is for fruits and vegetables – buy seasonal! Know your fruits by the season they grow in. If you buy strawberries in winter, it’s likely that they’ve been shipped in from abroad, harming the environment along the way, and taking lots of intense farming to grow them. Which brings us to another important point – buy local! Even if we buy all the right foods: Fairtrade, organic, seasonal, vegan food, it is not without its carbon footprint. The majority of food items come in plastic packaging, which can be greatly harmful to the environment – accumulating in fish, birds and sea mammals and ultimately in humans. Trying to buy foods with reduced packaging, such as loose fruits and vegetables, can significantly reduce carbon emissions and pollution. The other issue is food waste. We often buy more than we need, with around half of the food produced in the UK not being eaten. While it isn’t nice to run out of food, splitting your shop into two isn’t so bad given the amount of food – and money- it could save in the long run. So how can we do this affordably? Fairtrade and organic food can be quite expensive, so what is our best bet for keeping the cost low? Cooking meals from scratch can be cheaper than buying readily prepared options. If you have any garden space, or access to a community garden, growing your own food can be a great option, and can also help as you know exactly how it was grown and prepared. Although buying more than you need can contribute to waste, buying cheaper seasonal food in bulk can be a good option – as long as your remember to portion it and freeze it. That way it lasts a lot longer, and saves you a bit of money along the way. And finally, opting for ‘wonky veg’ – vegetables that don’t conform to specific aesthetical standards, but are just are delicious and nutritious – is significantly cheaper than the conventional ones. It can sometimes seem daunting to start checking for sustainable food, but just remembering a few simple things can help your health and can have a positive impact on the environment. Look out for the Fairtrade Mark, check whether food is organic, buy less meat, buy local seasonal food and try to only buy what you need. That way, you can make a real difference. Every year the Environment Team calculates the University’s carbon footprint for the previous fiscal year. Below you can find the data for 2016/17 academic year. Under the 2009 Climate Change Act all public organisations have a duty to report to the Scottish Government annual carbon (CO2) emissions from business operations. This is why every year we spend a good amount of time pulling up all the information requirewd to calculate our institution’s carbon footprint. But first let’s take a look at what carbon footprint actually constitutes in. Carbon footprint stands for the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted into the atmosphere and is a metric used to estimate the impact a process, a person, or an organisation has on climate change. Carbon, in this case, represents the sum total of all the greenhouse gases, which trap heat into the Earth’s atmosphere, thus causing global warming. A persons’ footprint translates into the amount of resources she or he uses. This includes the modes and frequency of travel; the type of diet they adhere to; the amount of energy they use; the amount of waste they produce, the products (clothes, electronics, etc.) they buy. In short, every action and purchasing decision we take has a carbon footprint associated with it. Water – similarly to our energy demand, the growth of the University results in more water consumption, with the highest demand in halls and labs. How does this create carbon? The water and sewage has to be pumped and treated and that uses electricity. Waste – as landfill waste decomposes it releases methane (CH4) which is 25 times more potent than carbon in trapping heat . Further, there are carbon emissions associated with waste processing and transportation. We want to reduce this as much as possible – moving to zero waste to landfill. Business travel – as an international institution lecturers, researchers and staff are travelling around the UK and the rest of the world. We are also just starting to measure and report our emissions from commuting to and from St Andrews. We do this on an estimate, based on car emissions from University-issued car parking permits and travel surveys. Tell us in the comment section – how do you get to class/work each morning? For the 2016/17 academic year the University’s carbon footprint amounts to 25,692 tonnes of CO2. This represents a 16% reduction in our carbon emissions from the previous year and 27.7% from our baseline in 2012/13! Emissions from Electricity (43%) declined from 11,970 to 11,018 tonnes – an 8% saving. Emissions from Heating (31%) – declined from 10,711 to 8,010 – a 25% reduction. The overall share of emissions from Travel also fell from 24% to 23%. The commissioning of the University’s BIOMASS DISTRICT HEATING at Eden Campus, Guardbridge. The biomass boiler went online in the beginning of January 2017 and during its first seven months of operation resulted in a 25% decline in CO2 emissions from heating. How can staff and students contribute to reducing emissions? Heating and electricity can both be big sources of emissions savings if used in a smart manner. Keeping radiators at medium to low temperatures and turning the heating off when opening a window would both result in fewer emissions overall. Turning off lights and plugging out electrical appliances further add up to emissions savings. Using LEDs will both save you money and reduce CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and waste disposal, since LEDs use less energy and last much longer than conventional bulbs. Just over the course of 2017, LEDs worldwide have saved 570 million tons of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere ! Lastly, if you are a University staff member, you can find out your office building’s energy profile by emailing environment@st-andrews.ac.uk asking for access to the energy monitoring system. Knowing your office building’s profile would allow you to identify any energy intensive areas and make changes accordingly. If your job involves a lot of business travel, opting for the greenest transportation mode will significantly contribute to our emissions reduction targets. When travelling around the UK – choosing rail over domestic air travel will have the single biggest effect on reducing emissions. The University offers first class rail travel for any business trips outwith Scotland as a way of encouraging more sustainable travel. If you have to travel for business within Scotland, rail, bus, or car share are all less carbon intensive than driving to a destination alone. And in the event there is no other suitable option than driving on your own – you can still bring your emissions down by opting for an e-car from our local car club. For more details on how to book an e-car for business travel, have a read through this information leaflet – E-Car for Staff. Monday saw the start of the annual Fairtrade Fortnight – a festival originating with the Fairtrade Foundation. University of St Andrews has been a Fairtrade University since 2007 and as such partakes in the celebrations at the end of February and beginning of March every year. The 2018 Fairtrade Fortnight runs from Feb 26th until Mar 11th and University of St Andrews’ Environment Team, along with a few student societies and Transition, have an extensive programme of events open to both staff and students, as well as to the public. What does Fairtrade actually mean? Fairtrade, as a certification body, conducts independent audits, ensuring those standards are met along a product’s supply chain. When all of the ingredients that can be Fairtrade in a given product are confirmed to comply with standards (e.g. sugar and cacao powder in chocolate chip cookies), the product is issued the FAIRTRADE Mark – a logo widely recognised by consumers, which signals the product’s sustainability credentials. In previous posts we have covered Fairtrade in much detail, and if you would like to learn more about the cause and certification criteria, have a read through our blog posts or visit the Fairtrade Foundation website. University of St Andrews continues to expand its fairtrade product range and 2017 saw the introduction of fairtrade bananas across campus. Currently 100% of bananas, sugar, coffee and hot chocolate, served on campus are fairtrade-certified, with 100% of tea, served in student accommodation and sold in University-owned retail outlets, also fairtrade certified. Our chefs are constantly experiment with different fairtrade ingredients such as rice in order to find the best fit for needs of such a large institution as ours. What events can I attend this year? A Fairtrade Tea and Coffee afternoon – Wednesday (Feb 28th), 4:30 – 6pm, Byre Theatre. This is a LiftShare Meet & Greet event – promoting the University’s car sharing scheme – and if you are in need of some caffeine and would like to learn more about LiftShare, stop by and don’t worry about staying for the whole event as it is a drop-in session! Another exciting event happening in the Byre is the screening of the documentary ‘The Chocolate Case’ – A group of journalists become aware of child slavery in the cocoa industry and, since slavery is a crime, they idea is to get convicted for eating chocolate. When the big companies refuse to cooperate by producing a slave-free chocolate bar, the team decides to do accept the challenge and make their own. If you are curious to see how well they managed and would like to try the slave-free chocolate bar, head over to the Byre Theatre on Friday (March 2nd) at 6pm. This is a FREE ticketed event and you can get your ticket either at the door, or pre-book online at http://byretheatre.com/events/the-chocolate-case/. Thirdly, we have a Fairtrade Vegan Bake-off taking place in the Mansfield building on Sunday (March 4th). You can enter the competition or simply attend and enjoy the finished result. We still have a few spaces left for competition entries and VegSoc are offering a prize for the winner (for more information, contact VegSoc directly). Tickets can be purchased through Eventbrite. We have many more events planned for you, most of which are FREE and include fairtrade goodies GIVEAWAYs, so please check out the event programme below! All events tagged with a star (*) are free of charge and will be accompanied by a fairtrade chocolate giveaway! With the academic year fast approaching we are excited to welcome a new cohort of students to University of St Andrews. It could be overwhelming for some when moving to a new place and learning your way around town. This is why as a recent graduate our sustainability intern, Mariya Simeonova, is here to offer some advice about how you can foster a low-carbon way of living as soon as you arrive in St Andrews. Hello and welcome, class of 2021! I know you must be equal parts excited and terrified about starting this new chapter of your life, and I would try to ease the load a bit by providing you with some handy and very concise information about everything sustainable in St Andrews. Many of you will be in catered halls, however, in case of getting tired of take-aways on weekend nights, here are some tips for grocery shopping and food preparation. Most grocery shops in town offer a variety of organic, and fairtrade products at affordable prices, so you are spoiled for choice. There also are many locally-owned shops offering regional and local food with minimal packaging, resulting in a lower carbon footprint. Further, Transition University of St Andrews runs a non-profit online and pop-up shop for affordable local, organic and fairtrade produce called The Tree, so make sure to check their website. When it comes to food preparation, chopping the produce into small pieces, allows for a faster cooking process and less energy consumption. Transition also offer various Skillshare events on how to cook and prepare food staples such as bread, chocolate and hummus, which you would otherwise buy from the store with all the packaging they come in. Moving on to the topic of commute, most University halls and buildings are within a walking distance from each other and the town centre. Yet, if you are based at DRA or Albany Park, you might be tempted every once in a while to call a taxi. Yet, there are so many cheaper and more sustainable options for you to consider. Walking is not only a great exercise but it also stimulates creativity and mindfulness. Plus the beautiful wildlife and architecture you come across when exploring St Andrews on foot is worth the walk! If you live in DRA for example and would like to do some grocery shopping, why not take a short cut through Lade Braes and head over to Aldi, Morrison or M&S? Cycling is a great way to travel carbon-free, and we work hard on ever-improving the cycling infrastructure in and around St Andrews. You can purchase a bicycle at some of the bike sales organised during Freshers’ Week, and cycling lights and robust bike locks can be found at a cost-price form the University Shop – just go in and ask for them as they are not on display. And if you miss the bike sale at the beginning of the academic year, fear not! Transition runs a bike hire scheme, lending bicycles equipped with everything you might need. If you would like to explore North-East Fife or even further, why not take advantage of your student discount and buy a week pass for public transport. The bus station is very central, the route network is good and you get free WiFi on board! And, in case you need to travel further afield, Leuchars railway station is just 20 minutes away by bus. Our university has partnered with E-car to create our very own car club! If you want to explore a route,not serviced by public transport, are moving house, or need a car for any other reason, we’ve got you covered! Our car club has a fleet of ten all-electric vehicles and a network of charging stations across campus, all at your disposal for an affordable price. There is such a wide variety of environmentally-themed student societies and local organisation, that we even have our very own Green Fayre at the start of Fresher’s Week. If you would like to meet our team and the rest of the ‘green’ societies and organisations, on Monday 11th September come along to the lawn, located between the University Library and the International Relations Building. There will be lots of friendly people to meet and chat with, live music, lots of freebies and maybe even some delicious food! For the purpose of brevity, this post doesn’t even begin to cover all the sustainable initiatives taking place across campus and the opportunities and amenities you have at your disposal. Hopefully I didn’t overwhelm you and will get the chance to chat about sustainability with some of you at Green Fayre! This week the Environment Team welcomed their new Sustainability Intern, Mariya Simeonova, to the team. Mariya recently graduated from the University of St Andrews with Geography and Management (BSc JH). She is looking forward to taking over and developing the projects that Lindsey Mackay, the previous Sustainability Intern, has been working hard on over the past year. Having spent four years studying about sustainability and environmental management, Mariya is keen to apply that knowledge to her new role and contribute to the University’s sustainability agenda. Over the next year, Mariya will be concentrating on outreach and engagement with the student community, university staff and local residents. Mariya’s main role consist in collaborating with university departments and units on sustainability initiatives such as the Environmental Facilitators Network, Fairtrade and the annual Travel Survey. Further, she will be working alongside Transition and student societies to deliver a calendar of environmentally-themed events including Green Fayre, Green Week and Fairtrade Fortnight. She will also support the other members of the team: David Stutchfield (Sustainability Manager) and Barbara Aitken (Environment Officer) on their projects and the development of the university’s wider sustainability agenda. You can stay up to date with what the Environment Team are working on through their Facebook page, Twitter and Instagram. This week we discuss green infrastructure and how estates and the management of buildings, both within the university setting and across the globe, has a huge potential to decrease carbon footprints within universities and businesses alike. Over the past year our blogs have been written by our current Sustainability Intern, Lindsey Mackay. We look forward to welcoming our new intern, Mariya Simeonova, who will be taking over from Lindsey and starting her new position with us in the Environment Team at the beginning of August. Over the past month or so the university campus has been very quiet. With classes over for the summer and students gone on holidays the university may seem like it has slowed down, however behind closed staff continue to work hard as we strive to make the university a better place. The Environment Team have been hard at work compiling data together for our annual end of year reporting. Data analysed will give the university a solid idea of how much energy has been using over the past academic year and the volumes of different types of waste that the university has produced. One of the main ways in which the university can reduce and lower its carbon footprint is through the design and management of its buildings. Since buildings currently account for 40% of global energy consumption, organisations, businesses and estates have the chance of making real, tangible change for the benefit of our environment. Our vision is to become a carbon neutral campus, not only because we aim to become a leader within environmental sustainability, but because increasing numbers of prospective students across the world are making critical decisions on which universities they are applying to based on what how committed the university is to sustainability and the environment. Within the university we strive for sustainability by driving down energy demands, production of waste being sent to landfill, with a strong focus on societal impacts and how overall financial savings can benefit the long term future of the university. These are all areas that are currently under consideration as we look towards updating the Carbon Management Plan. Our vision for planning and strategy development is to reflect current conditions and services, facilitate employee engagement in the development of plans, and formulate realistic targets which can be met by placing appropriate facilities and resources that encourage campus wide changes and conscious movements towards sustainability. The journey to carbon neutrality can also include low cost initiatives which use small, every day, behaviour changes which can have significant impact. We encourage our staff and students to get involved in any way they can, whether that be turning down thermostats in halls of residence or turning off electrical appliances before they leave the office at the end of the day. We were proud earlier in the year to have been awarded Cycle Friendly Campus with Distinction and we believe that this is just one way in which we are showing our commitment to positive change. The award recognises many different factors, however one of the main priorities is the provision of services and facilities, including bike shelters and training, available to staff members and students. This award has also helped to shape and direct the writing and planning of the university’s Travel Strategy which aims to guide future infrastructure and development. By targeting the needs of staff and students, using informed baselines we hope to encourage everyone to consider how they get to work and whether they could make a small change with the vision of large benefits. If you would like to learn more about the university’s plans for updating our Carbon Management Plan and other related strategies please email environment@st-andrews.ac.uk. Although the weather might be variable in Scotland we do often get a short wearing kind of day, and these should be taken advantage of. Whether you are considering what to do this summer holiday, or have already decided to spend some time at home, have a look at our recommendations of things to do in and around St Andrews, and in Scotland. Let us know if you decide to go exploring as we always love hearing from you. If you are considering how you are going to travel think about hiring out an E Car for the day. There are plenty to book out from various stations around St Andrews and are affordable and have low carbon emissions. If you want to know more, follow this link. Craigtoun Country Park, is just 2 miles from St Andrews and is easily accessible by bus, bike or on foot. Activities within Craigtoun Country Park include a playpark, rowing on the lake, crazy golf and trampolines! St Andrews has three beaches which you can enjoy, and on a warm day take a good book to read at. West Sands offers a long afternoon walk, and you can cut back along the Old Course finishing back at the 18th hole! East Sands is shorter but is just as popular. Grab an ice cream, take a walk along the pier and finish by strolling along the sea front. Last but not least is Castle Sands. Although the smallest beach in St Andrews, Castle Sands is perfect to take a picnic down to, and has a pool suitable for paddling in or for practicing your rock skimming skills. Along the coast from St Andrews you can discover quiet little harbour villages with excellent food and drink opportunities waiting to be discovered. These areas are accessible by bus (or be E Car!), or on foot if you fancy taking a long walk along the scenic coastal footpath. Villages including St Monans and Crail are worth visiting, with the Cocoa Tree Café in Pittenweem, and Anstruther’s famous Fish Bar a must! Stirling is a city rich in history with plenty to do for all ages and interests. Stirling is also surrounded by beautiful countryside, making for the perfect escape if you want some peace and quiet. The iconic Wallace Monument and Stirling Castle are well worth a visit and can be both done easily in a day. To get to Perth you could hire out on of the E Cars, or take a bus to Dundee and hop on a train to Stirling for the quickest route. Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, is well worth a visit even for a day or two. You won’t be short of things to do from visiting the Castle, to exploring the beauty of the Botanic Gardens. If you want to escape the hustle and bustle of the centre of city take a walk down to Stockbridge. There you will find beautiful cobbled streets waiting to be explored with many interesting coffee shops and lunch spots to be tried! We recommend travelling by train to enjoy the most scenic route to Edinburgh from St Andrews and to experience crossing the iconic Forth Rail Bridge. Trains run regularly from Leuchars and will take you straight into the heart of Edinburgh. Alternatively, you can take the X59 bus directly from St Andrews to Edinburgh. Skye is one of the most popular destinations for locals and tourists to visit. If you go you will understand why! The islands boasts stunning scenery and is a popular destination for walkers and climbers of all experiences. The island is also popular with those who love to see wildlife and, in particular, bird watchers. Skye is home to the White Tailed Sea Eagle which attracts many people from far and wide, however you may also be able to spot dolphins, whales and red deer! Other islands are easily accessible from Skye so if you wanted to extend your trip and discover more of Scotland you could do so with ease. Most people opt to rent a car if they are travelling to Skye, however you could also choose to take the train to Glasgow and then onward to Mallaig. From Mallaig a ferry can be taken which will take you to Skye and then the adventure really begins!\n",

            "ktamborrino@politico.com EMAIL_ADDRESS 870 894 — Republicans have claimed the price tag for a Green New Deal runs deep into the trillions of dollars — but a closer look at that number shows it's far from a reliable cost estimate. — Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell will call on the Commerce Department to launch a trade investigation into carbon emissions — an ask that isn't likely to be well-received by the Trump administration. — A bipartisan group of senators unveiled legislation Thursday aimed at curtailing Russian influence on the European energy market — a much-touted priority of the Trump administration. FINALLY FRIDAY! I'm your host, Kelsey Tamborrino. Squire Patton Boggs' James Eklund knew there have been 11 Alaska governors throughout Rep. Don Young's tenure in Congress. For today: Who holds the record for longest-serving Cabinet member in U.S. history? Send your tips, energy gossip and comments to ktamborrino@politico.com. Follow us on Twitter @kelseytam, @Morning_Energy and @POLITICOPro. A NUMBERS GAME: Republicans have been circling the Green New Deal resolution like sharks in recent days, sensing blood in the water and coordinating attacks ahead of an upcoming floor vote in the Senate. One number constantly pops up in their onslaught: $93 trillion. That's how much they say the non-binding resolution will cost. So where did it come from? The eye-popping figure came from a price estimate crafted from a report by the conservative think tank American Action Forum, but the number does not actually appear in the document, Pro's Zack Colman reports this morning. Instead it's the sum total of high-range estimates the report's authors put on various aspects of a Green New Deal platform — and most of which are based on sweeping assumptions about universal health care and jobs programs rather than the costs of transitioning to carbon-free electricity and transportation. That hasn't stopped the number from finding its way into popular lexicon, appearing last week at CPAC and on \"Saturday Night Live.\" AAF President Douglas Holtz-Eakin told Zack he was interested only in \"ballparks,\" adding the study is best viewed as \"a sincere but a heroic estimate of a not very well-specified proposal.\" But greens say the number is a convenient way for Republicans to get out of talking about the high cost of unchecked climate change.

HOUSE DEM CALLS FOR EMISSIONS PROBE: New Jersey's Pascrell will ask for a Section 232 investigation into carbon emissions from imports and whether they pose a threat to U.S. national security, Pro's Sabrina Rodriguez reports. \"Clearly, carbon dioxide emissions are exacerbated by international trade and imports to the United States. This carbon pollution threatens agricultural markets and infrastructure, among other sectors of our economy, which Commerce should investigate with the urgency and gravity that this emergency warrants,\" Pascrell writes in draft letter obtained by POLITICO. While the president has dismissed the science behind climate change, his administration must initiate an investigation based on Pascrell's ask, Sabrina reports. According to Commerce's Section 232 guide, the secretary is supposed to \"immediately\" start an investigation once a petition is received. The letter will be sent today or Monday at the latest, an aide said. NEEDS MORE FUNDING: Asked about a recent GAO report that found it may cost DOE $500 billion more and take an additional 70 years to clean up legacy environmental contamination from nuclear waste, Senate Energy Chairman Lisa Murkowski said she fears cleanup projects are underfunded around the country. \"This is the problem with so many of the cleanups — whether it's Superfund, whether it's our legacy wells up North, whether it's some of the waste management issues. We do not resource this appropriately,\" she told reporters. \"My sense about the issue more broadly is it's always about resourcing — whether it's money or manpower.\" Not scheduled: Murkowski hasn't yet scheduled administration witnesses to testify on President Donald Trump's budget request expected early next week, she said. TO RUSSIA, WITH LEGISLATION: The bipartisan European Energy Security and Diversification Act in the Senate would authorize up to $1 billion to help create U.S. public and private-sector energy investments in eligible countries from fiscal year 2019 to 2023, including natural gas and electricity infrastructure. Sens. Chris Murphy, Ron Johnson, Jeanne Shaheen, Ben Cardin, Marco Rubio, and Cory Gardner co-sponsored the bill in the Senate. Reps. Adam Kinzinger and Bill Keating will introduce the House companion bill. RALPH HALL DIES AT 95: Former Texas Rep. Ralph Hall, the oldest person in history to serve in the House, died Thursday at the age of 95, The Washington Post reports. A Democrat-turned-Republican, Hall was elected to Congress 17 times, and \"held prominent positions on the Energy and Commerce Committee, where he represented oil and gas industrial concerns important to Texans, and on the Science Committee, where, as a top-ranking member, he was an advocate for the space program,\" the Post writes. — \"Of all the people I've met and enjoyed serving with during my time in Washington, Ralph Hall was a true friend,\" said House Science Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson in a statement. \"... From the first time we met to that last time I visited him at his home in Rockwall, he remained the same caring, thoughtful, humorous and hardworking man throughout.\" — Ranking member Frank Lucas in his own statement said he'd \"always value the personal insights\" Hall shared about politics, the legislative process and life. \"He was sage and smart and I will miss him,\" he added. DISASTER FUNDING UPDATE: Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby told reporters he's still hoping to get a disaster relief package approved for Alabama before the end of next week. \"We're still talking,\" he said, adding it was \"looking good\" for next week. Shelby said there \"probably shouldn't be any problems\" to get funding to address the tornadoes that struck his state earlier this week. GRASSLEY HAMMERS 'FIRED PRUITT' OVER SMALL REFINER EXEMPTIONS: Sen. Chuck Grassley lacerated former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt for changing how the agency handled exemptions to the Renewable Fuel Standard. According to a report from Reuters, EPA made it easier for individual refineries, even those owned by highly profitable oil companies, to get out of complying with the program by widening the definition of economic hardship. EPA told Reuters it had made no changes. For Grassley, it was an \"I told you so\" moment. \"Surprise surprise news reports confirm what we said all along abt fired Pruitt was true,\" Grassley tweeted Thursday night. \"He said 1 thing&did another/EPA changed RFS waivers so BIG OIL got ridiculous hardship exemptions even tho they make billions $$$ EPA shld kno @realDonaldTrump supprts ethanol &act accordingly\" WATCHDOG GROUP CALLS 'SHENANIGANS': Liberal watchdog group Western Values Project accused the Interior Department of attempting to interfere with its ability to access public records related to a department proposal on political protests in D.C. parks, Pro's Ben Lefebvre reports. The group was told this week that DOI was submitting one of its FOIA requests for review by a senior political appointee before documents would be released, according to a March 4 email the conservation group cited on its website. CH-CH-CHANGES: EPA will restructure its Office of Research and Development to combine the science adviser role with a science policy division, the agency said Thursday. The change would see ORD slimmed down from 13 entities, including the immediate office of the ORD associate administrator, to eight, Pro's Alex Guillén reports. The science adviser and policy offices would be combined into the Office of Science Adviser, Policy and Partnerships. IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT: The conservative Club for Growth launched fresh attacks on progressives' Green New Deal in a new ad campaign that ties the proposal to the end of the world. The group launched a new website and five-figure digital ad campaign, dubbed \"Economic Armageddon,\" that will air across targeted U.S. markets. Watch the ad. — Amanda Eversole was named executive vice president of the American Petroleum Institute, President and CEO Mike Sommers will announce today. In the role, Eversole will oversee day-to-day operations and lead the group's strategic planning process. She previously served as API's chief operating officer and has held senior positions at J.P. Morgan Chase and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. — \"White House presses automakers to back fuel-efficiency rollback,\" The Washington Post. — \"Trump's California water order rushes science and cuts out public, emails show,\" KQED. — \"Forthcoming battery-storage incentive bills energize backers,\" Bloomberg Environment. — \"U.S. inching toward secondary sanctions on Venezuelan crude, product flows: sources,\" S&P Global Platts. — \"As extreme weather forces coal to falter, where will resilience come from?\" GreenTech Media.\n",

Chiropractors are spinal health experts and deal mostly with spinal health and alignment, but also treat other joints and muscles where necessary. Our chiropractors are five-year university trained, and fully registered under AHPRA. Most importantly, we are a very caring and friendly bunch! No. Our chiropractors can assess and treat you without a referral from a doctor.

Will Private Health Insurance cover some of my chiropractic care? Yes, if it is included in your 'Extras' cover (which usually includes Dental, Optometry, Chiropractic etc.). Depending on your level of cover, your private health insurance will pay a portion of your consultation/treatment fees, which we can claim on the spot in the clinic (for most providers) with you only having to pay the gap after. Please contact your private health insurance provider for more information. Medicare will cover up to 5 chiropractic visits a year, as part of their Chronic Disease Management program (previously known as Enhanced Primary Care).

Get an active start with a kayaking session and a scenic hike before getting immersed in surf culture at the surfing museum. Take a scenic cycle ride, try a local beer and enjoy a spectacular sunset and very traditional slice of Americana on the beach — toasting s’mores by the fire. Inclusions: Local English-speaking guide, coffee and a pastry, lunch worth $15 including a drink, kayak rental, entrance to the Ocean Institute, entrance to the Surf Museum, 1 hour electric bike rental, brewery food sampler and a drink, bonfire with s’mores, hotdogs and potato chips. Dana Point Lantern District Sign, 24292 Del Prado Ave, Dana Point, CA 92629. Waterfront Adventures Huntington Beach, close to the downtown area and Huntington Beach Pier. Your full day tour of the highlights of beautiful Orange County begins at the most romantic spot in California – Dana Point. We’ll kick things off with a coffee and a pastry to stave off any hunger pangs and then, after admiring the views, we’ll pick up your kayaking gear ready for our first activity. Your professional and experienced guide will assist you in getting familiar with your kayak and there will be an opportunity to change clothes before we get out on the water. We’ll take a jaunt around the harbor and chat about the interesting history and folklore of Dana Point before briefly hitting open waters to land on pretty Doheny Beach. After a spot of beach lounging, we’ll then head back to hand over our kayaks and grab a bite to eat by the harbor at one of our favourite spots, which offers a wide variety of bagels, sandwiches, burgers and salads. After lunch we’ll take a walk over to the Ocean Institute to learn more about local maritime life. The Institute is an education center and maintains two tall ships, the Pilgrim and the Spirit of Dana Point, for your viewing pleasure. We’ll then make our way up the Headlands and hike the trails that overlook the Pacific, reaching the Dana Point Nature Interpretive Center where you’ll discover more fascinating facts about our local wildlife. After a brief visit to the beach we shall make our way back to the starting point. There will be restrooms along the way on the tour and we strongly recommend that you bring a water bottle to refill and some comfortable walking shoes. Your Surf City experience begins on an electric bicycle for a heady and picturesque ride down the Huntington Beach Bike Trail north to Sunset Beach, with a stop for a few snaps/selfies at Bolsa Chica State Beach. At Sunset Beach we’ll sit and watch skilful locals surf the afternoon waves. After a picturesque 25 min ride back to town, we’ll return our bikes and walk to the International Surfing Museum. Here we’ll spend some time learning about how surf culture has shaped the state of California and discover some of surfing’s most beloved heroes. We’ll take a five-minute stroll along Main Street to the oldest brewery in Huntington Beach and one of our favorite watering holes. Here we’ll enjoy a locally brewed beer and a bite to eat as we sit on the outdoor patio overlooking Main Street and the Pacific Ocean. For our dessert, we’ll gather around a fire pit on the beach and eat S’ores, hot dogs and potato chips while watching the sunset! Can it get more USA than that?! We don’t think so! Before you go, your guide will be happy to give you recommendations on where to go once the sun has gone down and give you some tips on other things to see and during your stay in Orange County. Dress standard: Comfy and sporty for the hiking and cycling. You’ll also want swimwear for the kayaking. Please bring something warm for when the temperature dips in the evening. Additional Information: Walking distance is about 5 miles (8 kilometers) with approximately 50 yards/ meters elevation gain. The walking is spread out over in 6 hours with several breaks. If the weather is particularly bad, we will be unable to go ahead with the tour. Closure of sites: In the unlikely event of the fire pits on the beach not being available, we’ll find an alternative. Child Policy: Travelers under 12 years of age are not permitted to join this tour. We can accommodate vegetarians and other dietary restrictions.

            "NattyShack@ZenoGroup.com EMAIL_ADDRESS 1618 1642 There are all kinds of things to do in Augusta during the Masters (John Daly, as has become an Augusta tradition, will be selling merch in the Augusta Hooters parking lot all week). But here's something new: Taking place April 7-8 in Augusta right outside the Augusta National gates, the \"Natty Shack\" is targeting millennials who are in town for the first major of the year. Sponsored by Natural Light beer, there will be plenty of that, of course, along with television viewing areas, music, games, food and appearances by PGA Tour player Smylie Kaufman. The event is for golf fans ages 21-27. If you recall last year's Masters, Smylie had a storybook three rounds in his first Masters and was in the final group on Sunday with Jordan Spieth. But a final-round 81 put him out of contention and into T-29, out of the automatic qualifying for 2017. Natural Light signed the affable 25-year-old professional golfer last year to help attract a more youthful market segment. Kaufman, who has one win on the PGA Tour (2015 Shriners Hospital for Children Open), won't be playing in this year's Masters so he will be available to hang out with fans. \"Smylie,\" by the way, isn't Kaufman's first name. It's actually his middle name, and \"Carter\" is his first name. He got his middle name in honor of his grandmother's cousin, the late Smylie Gebhart an All-American defensive end for Georgia Tech in 1971. The 2014 LSU grad also has a brother named \"Lucky.\" The event will be sun-up to sundown on Thursday and Friday, but space is limited, so you have to sign up. The address of the Natty Shack is 2806 Washington Road. Email NattyShack@ZenoGroup.com to rsvp. If money was no object, this is how I might do the Masters: Take a helicopter ride to a really nice resort, play a round or two of golf and ride in a limousine each day at Augusta National. Well, that's exactly those going to Champions Retreat for a golf package can do. The luxury getaway has partnered with a luxury helicopter service. It's a ride-share platform called Evolux (ride share helps you split expenses because helicopters are expense to charter) that will take you from various locations to Champions Retreat, a luxurious golf community with three spectacular nines designed by Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player. Packages include helicopter transfer to Champions Retreat, accommodations, private car transfer to the tournament, golf and culinary, all entirely customizable. Helicopter transport is currently available from Atlanta and Charlotte, as well as Greenville, S.C., but you can inquire about rides from other markets, too. Prices vary, but needless to say, it isn't be cheap. Go to championsretreat.net/lifttothelinks for more information. A quick look on Stubhub.com right before the 2017 Masters reveals you can still get tickets to the Masters, but to no surprise, they're expensive. I mean, Super Bowl tickets-like expensive. Weekly badges (good Monday through Sunday) start out around $13,000 each, while Thursday through Sunday competition badges begin at $6,500. The cheapest ticket to get is the Monday practice round, but even that is $510. Wednesday practice round tickets, which include the par-3 contest, are listed at $1,550 and up. I still say your best bet if you don't have tickets yet and you just want to take in a practice round is to show up in Augusta and buy them off a scalper outside the gates, especially if the weather is a little iffy.\n",

            "zacb@wisconsinbikefed.org EMAIL_ADDRESS 1465 1490 As a regional director of Share and Be Aware, our comprehensive safety program around Wisconsin, it’s hard to imagine a way to de-stress my ride than to ride with my grandmother, sharing the city with her and helping make sure she is safe as she rides. The same happens when we drive in a car or go for a walk, but never before has a bike ride really been possible with Imogene (my grandmother). It is rare when a new program comes along with the ability to truly change the lives of many. Cycling Without Age – simple in concept, significant in impact – is just that type of program. Started in Denmark in 2012, Cycling Without Age is a program which allows residents who can no longer ride a bike the opportunity to experience many of cycling’s benefits – taking in the surroundings, fresh air, and visiting with others. Regardless of the level of care, we have a large number of residents who could benefit from this program. The joy of being outdoors and connecting with others are experiences no one wants to lose. Your gift of your time and/or donation will help more residents get outdoors by supporting the purchase of six custom-built bicycles over two years. Your support will help us reach our target of $40,000. As I look through the latest Heat maps of Wisconsin, I can’t help but think of the places I’d love to ride with my grandmother including the possibility of riding this year’s RAW. I hope to see you there! Leave a comment or send an email to zacb@wisconsinbikefed.org if you’re interested in a training to be able to help captain a rickshaw here in Madison. Ole Kassow is coming to both Oakwood locations on Thursday, March 10 to speak and meet with people helping us put this program together. Formal presentations will be at 10am at 6205 Mineral Point Road location and 3 at 5555 Tancho Drive (near American Family HQ). (Check out Ole’s partnership in Oshkosh as well!). This sure seems like a wonderful program. Staying engaged with one’s environment, and interacting with others is considered an important part of healthy aging. If this helps facilitate that, it’s a really good thing. Zac, I would love to see you ride RAW with your grandmother! Is she going to want to go 175 miles in a rickshaw?\n",

The Hill Country Film Festival opens today at 6:30 in Fredericksburg, Texas at Stagecoach Theater! A brief history of Grapetown School (#4 on the driving map, located on Old San Antonio Road): Built in 1884. Teacherage in 1887. Consolidated in 1949. One of four schools which still has the original teacherage, the house where the teacher lived. This limestone two-room teacherage was built in 1887, and later a frame kitchen, storeroom, and smokehouse was erected. It was used until 1949 when Grapetown School District was consolidated with Rocky Hill School District as part of the rural school consolidation in Texas. April 30 & May 1 , 2011 Saturday, 10 a.m.–6 p.m. Sunday, Noon–5 p.m. Three acres of lavender fields profusely bloom purple-blue under the Texas sun at Becker Vineyards. Rows of vibrant lavender contrast with the red, sandy loam soil it grows in. This is the Provence-like setting for Becker Vineyards’ Annual Lavender Festival. The event will feature speakers and vendors promoting lavender education as well as herb related products. There will also be gardening tips, cooking demonstrations, wine tasting, and luncheons.\n",

            "rkratowicz@putman.net EMAIL_ADDRESS 7667 7688 By Russell L. Kratowicz, P.E. Once again, it's time to present the results of a Web search that uncovered more zero-cost, noncommercial, registration-free resources for your approval. The objective this month is practical information about the discipline called design of experiments (DOE), which is a highly efficient methodology for optimizing a multi-variable production process rapidly, using a minimum of data. For example, DOE might apply to a conveyorized dryer. The general idea is to pack as much wet stuff as possible on the belt, pass it through the dryer only once as rapidly as possible to achieve a specific, identical part-to-part, minute-to-minute moisture content in each piece that exits the dryer. The relevant input variables might be temperature, spacing of wet items on the belt, conveyor speed, hot air flow and ambient humidity. A properly designed experiment minimizes the number of test runs needed to specify the best controller settings for the relevant variables. Then, with the hard work completed, operators need only tweak the settings a bit to pick up the last crumbs of operational improvement. The research this month kept turning up references to somebody named Taguchi. So, we might as well start with a side search to learn about this person of apparently mythic proportions in the field of DOE. Genichi Taguchi started making his impact on the American concept of quality in the early 1980s. You see, whereas it's common for us to speak in terms of the \"quality\" we've achieved, Taguchi speaks in terms of \"quality loss\" and the associated financial implications of reduced sales that occur when a process deviates from optimum. You can read his biography at several places. Try clicking over to http://www.skymark.com/resources/leaders/taguchi.asp or http://www.dti.gov.uk/mbp/bpgt/m9ja00001/m9ja0000111.html. The concept of designing efficient experiments applies to more than manufacturing and hypothetical continuous dryers. Imagine for a moment trying to teach DOE to students who've never even been inside a manufacturing plant. It requires a different frame of reference that William G. Hunter at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has nailed down quite nicely. He forces his students to come up with their own experiments, many of which are listed online. I refer you to a document titled 101 ways to design an experiment. Or some ideas about teaching design of experiments. You can find it at http://www.stat.wisc.edu/department/handouts/technical413/technical413.html. The piece is rather long, so in the interest of your own surfing efficiency, I'd suggest you scroll to about half way down the document to get to the 101 experiments his students optimized. They include fireworks fuses, hitching a ride, melting sidewalk ice, baking biscuits and getting a letter delivered across the country. DOE's great reliance on statistics means that it's necessarily a mathematically intense exercise. The best way to learn the process is to start with a simple problem. For example, you can read Communicating Design of Experiments to Non-Statisticians by Steve Schmidt and Ken Case. This article explains how DOE can be applied to rediscovering Newton's Law and Ohm's Law. It provides the fully worked-out mathematics for both cases. You'll find it at http://www.airacad.com/comdoe.htm. Fast forward to a college-level course and you get Statistics in Research II, a class taught by Oliver Schabenberger, former instructor at Virginia Tech. He was kind enough to post his lecture notes at http://kitchen.stat.vt.edu/~oliver/stat5616/LectureNotes.html. Also, you might be interested in his glossary, which is found at http://kitchen.stat.vt.edu/~oliver/stat5616/handouts/DOEVocabulary.pdf. You can find a slide show of the lecture notes for Design of Experiment and Robust Design, a course taught by Wayne Li from The University of Washington in Seattle. They cover only the high spots in what is probably an interesting class session, but it's rather sparse in terms of explanatory material. Nevertheless, I have no doubt you'll figure it out if you simply go with the flow and use your imagination. Li posts his material at http://courses.washington.edu/courseli/me355/Lectures/lecture19.pdf. But if you really want to get into the mathematics of statistics, the must-see online resource is the Engineering Statistics Handbook. This prodigious work shows you how to explore, measure, characterize, model improve, monitor and compare data sets using every statistical tool known to mankind. The work is heavily linked and interlinked, so there's no way to determine the document's length easily. Take my word for it, there's a lot of material here. Bookmark http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/ if you need to do any work with statistics. http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/sgleixner/mate166/lab_handouts.htm and learn how to think experimentally. www.dean.usma.edu/math/courses/ma376/handouts/Ma376_11.ppt. This PowerPoint presentation makes reference to something identified as Ho and Ha. In the branch of statistics called hypothesis testing, these correspond to the null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis, respectively. Gosh, that sounds like a topic for a future column. As you may have gathered by now, DOE is computationally heavy. In fact, with so much statistics involved, making sense of it is a job perfectly suited for digital processing. And I'm happy to report that, in their desire to make your foray into DOE as painless as possible, several Web sites offer you suitable software, some of which is free. http://www.pqm.cz/Engpqm/frsoftware.htm#free%20software, where you will find something called Five Easy Steps To Solving Production Problems. The package is suitable for DOE problems that feature four, five or six two-level factors. First, read through the worked-out example to be sure that your problem matches the capabilities of this DOS-based software package. Yes, that's rightDOS. But, it's free. What do you want? The next offering by Peter Bruce of Bruce Advertising brings you Statistics.com, a worthwhile site for all your statistical needs. Start with the free software downloads. There are no less than 40 totally free statistical software packages covering the full gamut of calculations needed to excel in this discipline, including DOE. Merely having the tools, though, is pointless unless you know how to use them effectively. So, while you're there, check out the online textbooks, a link to which is found on the left side of the page. Aim your avaricious mouse to http://www.statistics.com/content/freesoft/AZlisting.html to capture the goods. Rainer Wrlnder, IT manager with W.L. Gore & Associates near Munich, Germany, also publishes a list of software resources, some of which are free. The others are shareware, which means it's appropriate to trot out our standard caveat that applies to any shareware presented here. Shareware relies on the honor system. If you download and use it, you're expected to compensate the software developer. Details are downloaded with the files. Now, go visit Wrlnder 's page titled Statistical Software at http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Rainer_Wuerlaender/statsoft.htm and play nice. Before you leave, don't forget the related columns that appeared here in past issues. A two-parter on quantitative methods started in October 2000 and finished in January 2001. Also, a column on statistical process control appeared in the February 2001 issue. Both are available on the Plant Services Web site, which is found, amazingly enough, at http://www.plantservices.com. Rusell Kratowicz is executive editor of Plant Services magazine.

The Willie’s Warriors curriculum focuses on systems change, economic empowerment, communications and building alliances across movements and communities. Warriors have the opportunity to learn from experts and each other, gaining a deeper sense of themselves as leaders and how to sustain themselves while moving their communities forward. Willie’s Warriors is open to Black women from all sectors and industries interested in nurturing their leadership and relationships with other Black women leaders in the Chicago region. Applications for the Spring 2019 cohort of Willie’s Warriors have closed. Sign up for updates. Who was the Rev. Willie Barrow? Rev. Barrow believed in bringing women together to support and learn from each other. That work continues through Willie's Warriors, a leadership development cohort of Black women in the Chicago region. Rev. Barrow’s legacy and fierce commitment to justice lives on through The Willie Taplin Barrow Fund for Black Women’s Leadership at Chicago Foundation for Women. Willie’s Warriors was created to honor and continue the legacy of the Reverend Willie Taplin Barrow, with support from Rev. Barrow’s estate in partnership with African American Legacy (AAL) at the Chicago Community Trust. Willie’s Warriors is open to women who identify as Black, African American or as part of the African diaspora. The cohort is open to women, including trans-, cis-, and gender-nonconforming women, and non-binary individuals, from all sectors and industries, for- and non-profit, government, faith-based, and others, who are committed to building upon their leadership skills to advance issues of equity within their communities. What is the commitment involved in being a member of Willie’s Warriors? Willie’s Warriors will meet on a monthly basis beginning in Spring 2019. The opening and closing retreats will occur on a Friday and Saturday. Other sessions will be either Friday afternoon-evening or on Saturday. Cohort members will be responsible for arranging any time off from work required to attend the session. How many women will be selected? The Spring cohort will be comprised of 15-20 women. The fee for the program is $250 for cohort members. Fee waivers and discounts are available if this fee would pose a burden to a potential Warrior. What will selected Warriors gain from the program? The program curriculum will focus on systems change, economic empowerment, communications and building alliances. Warriors will gain a better sense of themselves as leaders and how best to sustain themselves while advancing goals of equity and justice, and moving their communities forward. Warriors will also build a network and relationships with other Black women leaders, as both mentors and mentees. A Selection Committee comprised of representatives from CFW and the Willie’s Warriors Advisory Board will review all applications. You may be asked to participate in an in-person interview in late January or early February. We anticipate notifying Warrior applicants of selection results by the end of February.

            "info@roulstonresearch.com EMAIL_ADDRESS 1929 1954 On June 28th, Roulston Research held a lunch on the automotive industry with Steve Lyons. Mr. Lyons is the Former President Ford Division, Ford Motor Company and Former President and CEO, Ford España. Topics that were discussed include the differences between GM and Ford, the future market for automobiles in China, and the future of electric cars, among other things. A majority of his insight came in comparing Ford to GM. In his opinion, Ford is positioned more favorably in the U.S., with better margins, and the U.S. market is expected to perform very well in the coming years for both companies. In Europe, the market outlook is much bleaker, with consolidation and downsizing nearly a necessity for all manufacturers. Ford has done a better job of closing plants in England, and has a clear plan for consolidation, whereas GM has only managed to close one German plant. In China, where there is the most room for growth, GM is in a much better position than Ford, owning the second largest market share in the country, only behind Volkswagen. They have a much better dealer network than Ford, something that will be increasingly difficult to improve, since the Chinese government has stopped giving licenses to new dealers. In the future of automobile types, it seems difficult to imagine electric vehicles becoming more than merely a niche vehicle, unless better technology is developed for improving the ability of batteries to hold their charge. On the other hand, natural gas power may become possible on larger vehicles, such as trucks, though remains a remote possibility for smaller automobiles. Finally, Mr. Lyons sees the American market as being able to support up to new 16 million units per year. If the industry eclipses that number, it may be prone to a market correction, as happened in the mid 2000’s. If you would like to hear the whole podcast, or engage in a 1 on 1 discussion with Steve, please email info@roulstonresearch.com.\n",

But I’m more worried about something that affects me personally — the common cold. With all this pain and suffering — with all of the advances in technology and science — why haven’t we found a doggone cure? Didn’t our scientists crack the human genome — the comprehensive blueprint for how to build a human being — back in 2000? And haven’t they been working on figuring out how to regenerate our cells and keep us alive for a very long time? Didn’t our scientists eradicate polio, smallpox, whooping cough, measles, bell bottoms, the shag haircut and pretty much everything else that came out of the ‘70s? I admit I’ve been on a lucky streak for nearly three years. I can’t remember the last time I had a cold, flu or even a scratchy throat. I’m not sure why, but I think it has to do with a couple of things I am doing right. First, though scientists say it is not so, I have found that several snorts of Jameson Irish Whiskey poured into a cup of tea — it’s even better without the tea — prevents me from catching a cold. Which means, ladies and gentlemen, that the men and women running for our country’s highest office are doing more to spread the cold virus than any other U.S. citizens. That’s just one more reason why I am so underwhelmed by the choices we have to pick among for the next president of the United States.

            "gustafsk@stolaf.edu EMAIL_ADDRESS 3754 3773 This morning, I guided my friend through a complex situation, managed a beach bar with an overwhelming number of customers and spotted a variety of flying fauna in a lush, colorful forest. I should also mention that my “friend” was an animated penguin, the “complex situation” was a surprisingly difficult maze, and I did all of the above in approximately twenty minutes from behind my MacBook Pro, in the comfort of my cozy first-year dorm, while my roommate was asleep and I was still in my pajamas. Lumosity, the company that made possible my varied accomplishments this a.m., is the latest “brain game” craze on the market. Despite its similarity in name to the word luminosity, I think it is important to note that Lumosity is short two vital letters in comparison. The company’s omission of these letters is the first cranial illusion we are given. Whereas luminosity describes the quality of being intellectually brilliant, Lumosity has no meaning whatsoever, except of course when associated with its longer-by-two-letters cousin. The idea of brain-training games is not a new one. I remember playing Brain Age on my lime green Nintendo DS long before lumosity.com surfaced; however, Lumosity’s claim to make you “smarter, sharper and brighter” three words that coincidentally mean exactly the same thing creates quite the draw in today’s society. According to the Alzheimer’s Association 2013 Facts and Figures, someone develops Alzheimer’s disease every 68 seconds. Startling statistics like this one, combined with an increasingly competitive job market, make maintaining and improving cognitive functions crucial to not simply surviving but succeeding. I found a couple of the website’s quotes enlightening. One said, “Analysis of our database shows that just 10-15 minutes of Lumosity training per day can lead to improvement in Lumosity over time.” Gasp. By playing the same games day after day, I will get better at those games? No wonder my first grade teacher so strongly encouraged making flashcards. Another professed that “Training 3-5 times per week produces the best Lumosity results.” Yet again, we see the claim for improvement within the website itself. What happened to changing my life, my overall intelligence? And by life I mean my actual life, not the one that relies on the proper functioning of my hard drive. I take offense at the company’s declarations that are supposedly supported by facts. The studies they reference have yet to be duplicated by other sources, though not for a lack of attempts. The phrases “science that works” and “clinically proven” are scattered throughout Lumosity’s marketing platform, yet these are embellished, at best. As someone who respects the scientific process, I cannot help but be repelled by the company’s proclaimed use of science with minimal supporting data. Aim for luminosity rather than success on Lumosity. Pay the $14.95 monthly price tag if you get some sense of personal satisfaction out of doing so, but if true intellectual advancement is your goal, I have some other suggestions. You could finish reading that book you started the summer before college but haven’t picked up since. Try a couple of the challenge exercises in your math textbook. You could watch a documentary or finally put your long-seeded ambition of becoming bilingual into action. We are surrounded by opportunities for intellectual growth; we just have to take advantage of them. My personal, day-long experience with Lumosity did have “wide-ranging effects,” as their ads claim. My account has been deleted, and I am now focusing on more tangible accomplishments. The only major downside I have encountered thus far is that I have to change out of my pajamas before I can start.

            "10408430601187624 CREDIT_CARD 4460 4477 This article is about the chemical phenomenon. For other uses, see Precipitation (disambiguation). \"Precipitate\" redirects here. For other uses, see Precipitate (disambiguation). Precipitation is the creation of a solid from a solution. When the reaction occurs in a liquid solution, the solid formed is called the 'precipitate'. The chemical that causes the solid to form is called the 'precipitant'. Without sufficient force of gravity (settling) to bring the solid particles together, the precipitate remains in suspension. After sedimentation, especially when using a centrifuge to press it into a compact mass, the precipitate may be referred to as a 'pellet'. Precipitation can be used as a medium. The precipitate-free liquid remaining above the solid is called the 'supernate' or 'supernatant'. Powders derived from precipitation have also historically been known as 'flowers'. When the solid appears in the form of cellulose fibers which have been through chemical processing, the process is often referred to as regeneration. Sometimes the formation of a precipitate indicates the occurrence of a chemical reaction. If silver nitrate solution is poured into a solution of sodium chloride, a chemical reaction occurs forming a white precipitate of silver chloride. When potassium iodide solution reacts with lead(II) nitrate solution, a yellow precipitate of lead(II) iodide is formed. Precipitation may occur if the concentration of a compound exceeds its solubility (such as when mixing solvents or changing their temperature). Precipitation may occur rapidly from a supersaturated solution. In solids, precipitation occurs if the concentration of one solid is above the solubility limit in the host solid, due to e.g. rapid quenching or ion implantation, and the temperature is high enough that diffusion can lead to segregation into precipitates. Precipitation in solids is routinely used to synthesize nanoclusters. Precipitation reactions can be used for making pigments, removing salts from water in water treatment, and in classical qualitative inorganic analysis. Precipitation may also occur when an antisolvent (a solvent in which the product is insoluble) is added, drastically reducing the solubility of the desired product. Thereafter, the precipitate may easily be separated by filtration, decanting, or centrifugation. An example would be the synthesis of chromic tetraphenylporphyrin chloride: water is added to the DMF reaction solution, and the product precipitates. Precipitation is also useful in purifying products: crude bmim-Cl is taken up in acetonitrile, and dropped into ethyl acetate, where it precipitates. Another important application of an antisolvent is in ethanol precipitation of DNA. In metallurgy, precipitation from a solid solution is also a useful way to strengthen alloys; this process is known as solid solution strengthening. The silver chloride (AgCl) has formed a solid, which is observed as a precipitate. This reaction can be written emphasizing the dissociated ions in a combined solution. This is known as the ionic equation. A final way to represent a precipitate reaction is known as a net ionic reaction. Many compounds containing metal ions produce precipitates with distinctive colors. The following are typical colors for various metals. However, many of these compounds can produce colors very different from those listed. Other compounds generally form white precipitates. Precipitate formation is useful in the detection of the type of cation in a salt. To do this, an alkali first reacts with the unknown salt to produce a precipitate that is the hydroxide of the unknown salt. To identify the cation, the color of the precipitate and its solubility in excess are noted. Similar processes are often used in sequence – for example, a barium nitrate solution will react with sulfate ions to form a solid barium sulfate precipitate, indicating that it is likely that sulfate ions are present. Digestion, or precipitate ageing, happens when a freshly formed precipitate is left, usually at a higher temperature, in the solution from which it precipitates. It results in cleaner and bigger particles. The physico-chemical process underlying digestion is called Ostwald ripening. ^ Dhara, S.

            "443096405733596 CREDIT_CARD 5031 5046 St. John House Rentals is part of St. John Links, created, owned, and operated by longtime St. John resident Jean Vance. Known as “Mean Jean” around the island, Jean has been designing websites and helping Virgin Islanders promote their homes, businesses, and artwork pretty much since the Internet connected this piece of paradise with the rest of the world. She’s tough to spot but, like the turtles and spotted eagle rays, she’s out there, so keep your eyes open while you’re snorkeling. Don’t be scared. She’s not mean at all. And plan to visit soon. The water feels so good. I have a question about the pricing on villas. When you see a price and it says something like “$2600/week for 1 bedroom, $3000/week for 2 bedrooms, etc.” does that mean I can expect to see another couple renting at that villa at the same time I am??? Or, does that simply mean that I promise (or am not allowed) to use only 1 of the bedrooms in that house? Hello Pat, No you will not have another couple renting the villa at the same time. Many of the houses that have more than one bedrooms will rent the whole house and close off the other bedrooms or let you know you are not allowed to use them. Enjoy your time on St. John. Thank you Jean. My wife and I are considering spending the whole month of May 2013 at a villa on St. John. It’s going to be difficult to figure out which one offers the nicest accommodations for the best price! I see there are many to choose from. We really like hiking, and playing in the water. We also really enjoy a spectacular view! We don’t always like being right down by the water, though, house-wise, because if the wind howls for more than a few days it can become obnoxious. With all this in mind, do you have an suggestions as to specific villas to consider? We’d like to keep our expenses for housing to about $3000/week or less. A month on St. John sounds divine! All of the properties featured on St. John Links are wonderful and each has something different to offer. What we suggest is perusing the site — you can search by number of bedrooms, or choose by location or price — and narrowing your search down to a few houses. Then you can contact the owners or property managers directly to answer specific questions that will help you choose the house that’s perfect for you. No matter which villa you choose, you will never be far from hiking and water! Hi Jean! Do you know of any long-term rentals in or around Cruz Bay Area beginning October or November 2014 for 3-6+ months? 1 or 2 beds, pet friendly (1 well-behaved dog). Thanks! Hello David. I am sorry to say I can’t help you there. I don’t know of any at this time but if I do hear of something I will email you. You may want to contact http://www.connectionsstjohn.com. They have a board where people advertise. I think for $5 a month you can put up an ad looking for a place or perhaps they can let you know of somewhere. Good luck. Great time to come. Welcome to St John soon. We are interested in using a villa from your website however want to confirm paying with a check is the norm. Thank you. Sorry for the wait on your reply, I was flying to the US for the holidays with my family. Just got in. The answer to your question is yes, paying with a check is the norm. There are a few people who are set up with paypal or do credit cards but very few. Have a great time on St. John. Hello I’m interested in your rental property Cruz Bay Cottage the last week in August and the first week in September is there any break from for two week rental ? You need to go to this page http://stjohnhouserentals.com/1bedroom/cruz-bay-cottage/ for Cruz Bay Cottage and click on the email link to get the person who can answer your question. At St John House Rentals our homes are owned or run by a number of individuals and management companies and they all do their own booking. The email link on each home’s page will get you directly to the person who can help! We at St John House Rentals do not do bookings. I hope this helps. Thanks for using my site. I’m sorry is it available thoses weeks ? I’ve been informed by James Miller that your posted Summer rates for Cinnamon Bay Estate (http://stjohnhouserentals.com/3bedrooms/cinnamon-bay-estate/) are out of date. I appreciate the heads up. Will contact James to fix it right away. Cinnamon Bay Estate rates are updated. Thanks for keeping me on my toes. We just purchased a home in Coral Bay and would like to know how we can be on your site? We are in the Estate Zootenvaal area. Congratulations on your new home. What a great area, so beautiful. Thanks for your request. I would make a page for you on my site http://stjohnhouserentals.com/and the email would go to you and you do the booking. My currant fee structure is $50 a month, $600 a year payable biannually or annually. If you choose to go with my site I can will need pictures and text which I can get off of either your site or VRBO. Know I promote the houses on my Facebook page for my business https://www.facebook.com/St-John-Links-443096405733596/ and since your house is in Coral Bay I will add a small video and link to your page on my http://coralbaystjohn.com/ for no extra charge. Hi! We are looking for a long-term rental beginning in April or May. We need two bedrooms as we have 1 9 yr old daughter. We’re planning to stay 6 mos to 1 year, so we’d need something that could accommodate that. Do you know of anything? Could possibly get one of us there in March if something comes available. I saw a couple of listings on Craigslist, but they’re available now. I doubt the owners would want to wait until April or May to rent out their property. Any help would be appreciated. We’ve been planning this move for several years, and had to postpone because of Irma’s unwelcome visit to the island.\n",

In case that cancellation is communicated at least 15 days before the starting date of the staying the full amount will be refunded, except for the € 120 deposit. This deposit can be used as a payment for another course starting in the next two years. 1.3.2. In case that cancellation is communicated in less than 15 days before the starting date the student will be required to pay two weeks of the course and accommodation fees. The course fee for those two weeks can be used as a payment for a future course. The difference with the total amount for the stay will be refunded. 1.3.3. Once the course has begun, total or partial cancellation of the course is not acceptable. If the course still has to be paid, the student will be required to pay the full costs. Management will give the possibility of postponing the booking of the course to other period. In order to grant this, a signed, stamped and transferable document will be handed to the student. Regarding accommodation, 2 weeks fees of the outstanding booking have to be paid. 2.1.1. The distribution of courses and levels is the responsibility of the teaching team, who, considering the test, interview and language needs of the student, will take the final decision of where the student will be placed in. Levels and their distribution will be established on the first Monday of the course after the interview and the test -this means that you will begin in your appropriate level at 11:50 in the same morning. 2.1.2. The criteria that justifies these decisions will be strictly academic. The maximum number of students is 6, but exceptionally, and with the unanimous approval of all participants, this could be increased. 2.1.3. Since it is the aim of the academic directorate to arrange that the study groups whilst working at the highest level possible, are also made up of a minimum number of students within the group, it may happen that a group consists of one student only. Such being the case, the student who attends an intensive language course will receive half of the classes reserved (which will comprise the technical elements of the program) in a private class and the other half (the practical activities of the program) with the group at the nearest level to that intended -provided that it is possible. The student who attends a specific purpose course will receive 70% of this course, the other 30% may be attended in an intensive language course. 2.2.1. The student who considers changing group convenient for him, must ask a teacher for it. Teachers and the Academic Manager will decide whether the change is appropriate and/or beneficial to the student or not. 2.2.2. Changing the course from General (A) into General (B) is possible. The cost will be € 68 per week. Changing the course from General (B) into General (A) usually is not possible because it is considered a way of cancellation. 2.3.1. Extending a course must be requested to and approved by Management, who will formally agree to communicate the decision within 24 hours. Please ask for it as soon as possible: the sooner the asking for an extension is addressed to Management, the more benefits you will have for organising the stay. 2.3.2. If course subscription is extended, the price will be calculated according to the total number of weeks; that results in a cheaper cost than considering it a new booking. 2.3.3. The participation in a course goes from Monday to the Friday of the last week of stay. Prolongation to make up for any lost days, until next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday... could be considered by Management, and if approved, it would be free of charge. Usually, it is possible if the group remains open. 2.3.4. The beginning and/or departure at different days must be accepted by Management. The prices to be applied will be proportional to the total number of weeks. 2.4.1. The Centre provides for the necessary materials, including a grammar book and exercises that correspond to the student level. This belongs to the student and is included in the fee. 2.4.2. The registration also includes the use of all school materials available at the Centre. These materials are the property of the school. If used, must be returned to the school prior to departure. 2.4.3. The use of books and related materials must be made according to the normal and customary rules of loans: that is to say, it is forbidden to mark and/or write on them; in addition, they must be returned in the same good condition they were received. 2.4.4. The school, as long as it may be possible -but without any commitment to it- will facilitate the acquisition of most of the materials used. 2.5.1 At the end of the course, every student will obtain a certificate of assistance. To obtain this certificate, it is necessary an assistance not inferior to 90 %. It means that the right to obtain this certificate will be cancelled if non-justified absences are superior to 10 %. 2.5.2. You can obtain a certificate of level. It will implicate some specific tests organised by the Academic Management of the School. 2.5.3. All certificates include administrative costs of € 5. 3.1. The price of the school’s accommodation includes bedclothes (sheets and blankets), but no towels. It also includes electricity, gas, water, heating, community tax and cleaning (once a week, minimum). Most of the apartments also have television and telephone, but not all of them contain these facilities. All the students have access to the swimming pool located in some of Castila's sites. 3.2. Placement of the students is the responsibility of the school. The school will always consider, to ensure the best possible placement, the criteria of distance, number of people to share the place, status, age, etc. 3.3. Accommodation lasts from Sunday to the Saturday of the last week of stay. Arrival before Sunday and / or extension until Sunday will be considered by Management. Apply for it. 3.5. Double room and bookings: The double room is guaranteed for those students/companions that booked a room for two in advance. In case of one person booking a double room and no other reservation to complete it in the same period, the student will be placed in a single room regime, as far as price and billing are concerned. 3.6. Changing of accommodation will be possible when Management finds it feasible. 4.1. As far as the Spanish family regime is concerted, all responsibility belongs to the school. This should be taken into account and consideration concerning to possible complaints, charges, extension of staying and/or any other requests. 4.2.

You have answers and trappers have questions. In closing … it is with a saddened heart that I report to you what I learned today via phone call. Oklahoma suffered a GREAT loss last month with the passing of Mr. Carl Carnahan. For those whom had the pleasure of meeting or knowing Carl, no words are necessary to describe how blessed you are. For those who never met Carl, I can tell you with absolute certainty that Oklahoma and Conservation are both at a lesser without him. Carl was one of the original founding fathers of the National Wildlife Control Operators Association during the inception discussions and the Father of Nuisance Wildlife Control in Oklahoma. He was an avid outdoors-man, conservationists, predator caller, trapper, fisher, hunter and retired Veterinarian. Even though he held proudly those titles and activities close to his heart, he was much, much more. He was a very loving family man and his actions towards his family and strangers should be exemplified. I know we have limited space in the publication for reports, but I could go on and on about Carl to the point that I would end up with a bestselling Biography about him if I continue. I can only hope and strive to be half the person Carl was and if I achieve that, a great man I would make. Carl … you are missed and our prayers be with your family. The seasons are around the corner so remember to take a kid or twelve out hunting, fishing or trapping with you when you go … the activity can literally have a positive effect on their lives and how they grow up. Please remember there is benefit in joining the NTA, but if you don’t join the NTA … then join the FTO or another non-profit wildlife conservation organization. Make your voice heard. We hope to see you at the Fall Meeting in Okmulgee where Family, vendors, instruction and fellowship will be readily on hand. Please be safe, God bless you all and take care.\n",

            "67232012005000033 CREDIT_CARD 12855 12872 Abstract: In this work were developed and evaluated films of poly(vinyl chloride)-PVC additivated with orange essential oil – OEO. These films were evaluated with FT-IR spectroscopy; mechanical tests; migration OEO in simulants; and determination of stability after sterilization by gamma radiation at a dose of 25 kGy. The OEO was assessed with GC-MS and analysis of antimicrobial activity. The films were prepared by the casting solution technique. The essential oil concentrations in PVC were 2%, 10% and 30% (w/w). The results showed that the OEO was incorporated into the polymer matrix and that this oil had antimicrobial activity against the bacteria E. coli and S. aureus. The migration of OEO in the films occurred with all simulants. The incorporation of OEO in the films also made them more flexible. It was also found that additive with 30% w/w OEO provides a protective effect for the polymer after sterilization by gamma radiation. Realini, C. E., & Marcos, B. (2014).

            "13569310500097265 CREDIT_CARD 19284 19301 Not to be confused with social democracy. Democratic socialism is a political ideology that advocates political democracy alongside social ownership of the means of production, often with an emphasis on democratic management of enterprises within a socialist economic system. Democratic socialists see capitalism as inherently incompatible with the democratic values of liberty, equality and solidarity; and believe that the issues inherent to capitalism can only be solved by superseding private ownership with some form of social ownership. Ultimately, democratic socialists believe that reforms aimed at addressing the economic contradictions of capitalism will only cause more problems to emerge elsewhere in the economy, that capitalism can never be sufficiently “humanized”, and that it must therefore ultimately be replaced with socialism. Democratic socialism is distinguished from both the Soviet model of centralized socialism and from social democracy, where “social democracy” refers to support for political democracy; the nationalization and public ownership of key industries but otherwise preserving, and strongly regulating, private ownership of the means of production; regulated markets in a mixed economy; and a robust welfare state. The distinction with the former is made on the basis of the authoritarian form of government and centralized economic system that emerged in the Soviet Union during the 20th century, while the distinction with the latter is made on the basis that democratic socialism is committed to systemic transformation of the economy while social democracy is not. The term “democratic socialism” is sometimes used synonymously with “socialism”; the adjective “democratic” is often added to distinguish it from the Leninist, Stalinist and Maoist types of socialism, which are widely viewed as being non-democratic in practice. Democratic socialism is not specifically revolutionary or reformist, as many types of democratic socialism can fall into either category, with some forms overlapping with social democracy, supporting reforms within capitalism as a prelude to the establishment of socialism. Some forms of democratic socialism accept social democratic reformism to gradually convert the capitalist economy to a socialist one using pre-existing democratic institutions, while other forms are revolutionary in their political orientation and advocate for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie and the transformation of the capitalist economy to a socialist economy. Democratic socialism is defined as having a socialist economy in which the means of production are socially and collectively owned or controlled alongside a politically democratic system of government. In contrast, other tendencies of democratic socialism advocate for eventual socialism that follow a gradual, reformist or evolutionary path to socialism, rather than a revolutionary one. Often, this tendency is invoked in an attempt to distinguish democratic socialism from Marxist–Leninist socialism, as in Donald Busky’s Democratic Socialism: A Global Survey, Jim Tomlinson’s Democratic Socialism and Economic Policy: The Attlee Years, 1945-1951, Norman Thomas Democratic Socialism: a new appraisal or Roy Hattersley’s Choose Freedom: The Future of Democratic Socialism. A variant of this set of definitions is Joseph Schumpeter’s argument, set out in Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (1941), that liberal democracies were evolving from “liberal capitalism” into democratic socialism, with the growth of workers’ self-management, industrial democracy and regulatory institutions. The most influential revisionist Labour thinker, Anthony Crosland…, contended that a more “benevolent” form of capitalism had emerged since the [Second World War] … According to Crosland, it was now possible to achieve greater equality in society without the need for “fundamental” economic transformation. For Crosland, a more meaningful form of equality could be achieved if the growth dividend derived from effective management of the economy was invested in “pro-poor” public services rather than through fiscal redistribution. Some proponents of market socialism see it as an economic system compatible with the political ideology of democratic socialism. The term democratic socialism can be used even another way, to refer to a version of the Soviet model that was reformed in a democratic way. For example, Mikhail Gorbachev described perestroika as building a “new, humane and democratic socialism.” Consequently, some former Communist parties have rebranded themselves as democratic socialist, as with the Party of Democratic Socialism in Germany. Justification of democratic socialism can be found in the works of political philosophers like Charles Taylor and Axel Honneth, among others. Honneth has put forward the view that political and economic ideologies have a social basis, that is, they originate from intersubjective communication between members of a society. Honneth criticises the liberal state because it assumes that principles of individual liberty and private property are ahistorical and abstract, when, in fact, they evolved from a specific social discourse on human activity. Contra liberal individualism, Honneth has emphasised the inter-subjective dependence between humans; that is, our well-being depends on recognising others and being recognised by them. Democratic socialism, with its emphasis on social collectivism, could be seen as a way of safeguarding this dependency. Fenner Brockway, a leading democratic socialist of the Independent Labour Party, identified three early democratic socialist groups in his book Britain’s First Socialists: 1) the Levellers, who were pioneers of political democracy and the sovereignty of the people; 2) the Agitators, who were the pioneers of participatory control by the ranks at their workplace; 3) and the Diggers, who were pioneers of communal ownership, cooperation and egalitarianism. The tradition of the Diggers and the Levellers was continued in the period described by EP Thompson in The Making of the English Working Class by Jacobin groups like the London Corresponding Society and by polemicists such as Thomas Paine. Their concern for both democracy and social justice marks them out as key precursors of democratic socialism. The term “socialist” was first used in English in the British Cooperative Magazine in 1827 and came to be associated with the followers of the Welsh reformer Robert Owen, such as the Rochdale Pioneers who founded the co-operative movement. Owen’s followers again stressed both participatory democracy and economic socialisation, in the form of consumer co-operatives, credit unions and mutual aid societies. The Chartists similarly combined a working class politics with a call for greater democracy. Many countries have this. Democratic socialism became a prominent movement at the end of the 19th century. In Germany, the Eisenacher socialist group merged with the Lassallean socialist group, in 1875, to form the German Social Democratic Party. In Australia, the Labour and Socialist movements were gaining traction and the Australian Labor Party (ALP) was formed in Barcaldine, Queensland in 1891 by striking pastoral workers. A minority government led by the party was formed in Queensland in 1899 with Anderson Dawson as the Premier of Queensland where it was founded and was in power for one week, the world’s first democratic socialist party led government. The ALP has been the main driving force for workers’ rights in Australia, backed by Australian Trade Unions, in particular the Australian Workers’ Union. Since the Whitlam Government, the ALP has moved towards Social Democratic and Third Way ideals which are found among many of the ALP’s Right Faction members. Democratic Socialist, Christian Socialist, Libertarian Marxist and Agrarian Socialist ideologies lie within the ALP’s Left Faction. In the United States, Eugene V. Debs, one of the most famous[according to whom?] American socialists, led a movement centered on democratic socialism and made five bids for President, once in 1900 as candidate of the Social Democratic Party and then four more times on the ticket of the Socialist Party of America. The socialist industrial unionism of Daniel DeLeon in the United States represented another strain of early democratic socialism in this period. It favoured a form of government based on industrial unions, but which also sought to establish this government after winning at the ballot box. The tradition continued to flourish in the Socialist Party of America, especially under the leadership of Norman Thomas, and later the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). Upon the DSA’s founding in 1983, Michael Harrington and socialist-feminist author Barbara Ehrenreich were elected as co-chairs of the organization. Currently philosopher and activist Cornel West is one of several honorary chairs. The organization does not run its own candidates in elections but instead “fights for reforms… that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.” More recently, the US Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont described himself as a democratic socialist. In Britain, the democratic socialist tradition was represented in particular by William Morris’s Socialist League, and in the 1880s by the Fabian Society, and later the Independent Labour Party (ILP) founded by Keir Hardie in the 1890s, of which George Orwell would later be a prominent member. In the early 1920s, the guild socialism of G. D. H. Cole attempted to envision a socialist alternative to Soviet-style authoritarianism, while council communism articulated democratic socialist positions in several respects, notably through renouncing the vanguard role of the revolutionary party and holding that the system of the Soviet Union was not authentically socialist. During the 1970s and 1980s, prominent democratic socialists within the Labour movement included Michael Foot and Tony Benn, considered by many to have redefined democratic socialism into an actionable manifesto which was, however, voted overwhelmingly against in the General Election of 1983 and referred to as ‘The longest suicide note in history’. The modern Labour Party has often referred to itself as a democratic socialist party throughout the 20th century, and explicitly identifies as such in Clause IV of its Rule Book. In other parts of Europe, many democratic socialist parties were united in the International Working Union of Socialist Parties (the “Two and a Half International”) in the early 1920s and in the London Bureau (the “Three and a Half International”) in the 1930s, along with many other socialists of different tendencies and ideologies. The socialist Internationales sought to steer a course between the social democrats of the Second International, who were seen as insufficiently socialist (and had been compromised by their support for World War I), and the perceived anti-democratic Third International. The key movements within the Two and a Half International were the ILP and the Austromarxists, and the main forces in the Three and a Half International were the ILP and the Workers’ Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) of Spain. In Italy, the Italian Democratic Socialist Party broke away from the Italian Socialist Party in 1947, when this latter joined the Soviet-funded Italian Communist Party to prepare the decisive general election of 1948. Despite remaining a minor party in Italian Parliament for fifty years, its leader Giuseppe Saragat became President of Italy in 1964. During India’s freedom movement, many figures on the left of the Indian National Congress organised themselves as the Congress Socialist Party. Their politics, and those of the early and intermediate periods of Jayaprakash Narayan’s career, combined a commitment to the socialist transformation of society with a principled opposition to the one-party authoritarianism they perceived in the Stalinist revolutionary model. This political current continued in the Praja Socialist Party, the later Janata Party and the current Samajwadi Party. In Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto introduced the concept of democratic socialism, and the Pakistan Peoples Party remained one of the prominent supporters for the socialist democratic policies in the country. In Nepal, B.P Koirala introduced the concept of democratic socialism. In the Middle East, the largest democratic socialist party is the Organization of Iranian People’s Fedaian (Majority). The Folkesocialisme (translated into “popular socialism” or “people’s socialism”) that emerged as a vital current of the left in Nordic countries beginning in the 1950s could be characterised as a democratic socialism in the same vein. Former Swedish prime minister Olof Palme is an important proponent of democratic socialism. Democratic socialists have espoused a variety of different socialist economic models. Some democratic socialists advocate forms of market socialism where socially-owned enterprises operate in competitive markets, and in some cases, are self-managed by their workforce. On the other hand, other democratic socialists advocate for a non-market participatory economy based on decentralized economic planning. Democratic socialism has historically been committed to a decentralized form of economic planning opposed to Stalinist-style command planning, where productive units are integrated into a single organization and organized on the basis of self-management. Contemporary proponents of market socialism have argued that the major reasons for the failure (economic shortcomings) of Soviet-type planned economies was the totalitarian nature of the political systems they were combined with, lack of democracy, and their failure to create rules for the efficient operation of state enterprises. Eugene V. Debs and Norman Thomas, both of whom were United States presidential candidates for the Socialist Party of America, understood socialism to be an economic system structured upon “production for use” and social ownership in place of private ownership and the profit system. The following is a list of socialist parties and democratic socialist parties around the world. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Two times Mexican Left-wing presidential candidate and ex head of Government of Mexico City. Albert Einstein, German-born physicist. He wrote about his political views in a 1949 article titled Why Socialism? Yanis Varoufakis, former Greek finance minister. Robert Heilbroner: “There is, of course, no conflict between such a socialism and freedom as we have described it; indeed, this conception of socialism is the very epitome of these freedoms,” referring to open association of individuals in political and social life; the democratization and humanization of work; the cultivation of personal talents and creativities. For me, socialism has meaning only if it is democratic. Of the many claimants to socialism only one has a valid title—that socialism which views democracy as valuable per se, which stands for democracy unequivocally, and which continually modifies socialist ideas and programs in the light of democratic experience. This is the socialism of the labor, social-democratic, and socialist parties of Western Europe. ^ Curian, Alt, Chambers, Garrett, Levi, McClain, George Thomas, James E., Simone, Geoffrey, Margaret, Paula D. (October 12, 2010). The Encyclopedia of Political Science Set. CQ Press. p. 401. ISBN 978-1933116440. Though some democratic socialists reject the revolutionary model and advocate a peaceful transformation to socialism carried out by democratic means, they also reject the social democratic view that capitalist societies can be successfully reformed through extensive state intervention within capitalism. In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism. Private property must be superseded by a form of collective ownership. ^ Curian, Alt, Chambers, Garrett, Levi, McClain, George Thomas, James E., Simone, Geoffrey, Margaret, Paula D. (October 12, 2010). The Encyclopedia of Political Science Set. CQ Press. p. 401. ISBN 978-1933116440. Democratic socialism is a term meant to distinguish a form of socialism that falls somewhere between authoritarian and centralized forms of socialism on the one hand and social democracy on the other. The rise of authoritarian socialism in the twentieth century in the Soviet Union and its sphere of influence generated this new distinction. ^ Eatwell & Wright, Roger & Anthony (March 1, 1999). Contemporary Political Ideologies: Second Edition. Bloomsbury Academic. p. 80. ISBN 978-0826451736. So too with ‘democratic socialism’, a term coined by its adherents as an act of disassociation from the twentieth-century realities of undemocratic socialism…but also, at least in some modes, intended to reaffirm a commitment to system transformation rather than a merely meliorist social democracy. ^ a b Busky, Donald F. (July 20, 2000). Democratic Socialism: A Global Survey. Praeger. pp. 7–8. ISBN 978-0275968861. Democratic socialism is the wing of the socialist movement that combines a belief in a socially owned economy with that of political democracy. Sometimes simply called socialism, more often than not, the adjective democratic is added by democratic socialists to attempt to distinguish themselves from Communists who also call themselves socialists. All but communists, or more accurately, Marxist-Leninists, believe that modern-day communism is highly undemocratic and totalitarian in practice, and democratic socialists wish to emphasize by their name that they disagree strongly with the Marxist-Leninist brand of socialism. ^ Kendall, Diana (January 2011). Sociology in Our Time: The Essentials. Cengage Learning. pp. 125–127. ISBN 978-1111305505. Sweden, Great Britain, and France have mixed economies, sometimes referred to as democratic socialism—an economic and political system that combines private ownership of some of the means of production, governmental distribution of some essential goods and services, and free elections. For example, government ownership in Sweden is limited primarily to railroads, mineral resources, a public bank, and liquor and tobacco operations. ^ a b Draper 1966, Chapter 7: The “Revisionist” Facade. ^ What is Democratic Socialism?

ROXLEY’S PERSONEL NOTES ON CLINTON’S WALK FOR JUSTICE MEETING IN CANBERRA. Elaboration of the notes already seen as they were just supposed to be memory queues. This is the general gist of where I think people’s heads are at on these points. That the PM, opposition leader and governor general have been notified that the first nations have begun to talk about treaty but not a treaty with Australia.Inc , A entity questionable of sovereignty itself . Clans and Nations have started to call for treaties among ourselves. Treaties to reaffirm songlines of connection, strength, knowledge, trade and trust. It’s not about giving one all the right to speak but letting us all work out who speaks where n for what, so when we have a problem or need help we can mediate, train ,support and resource through right channels. What we have we got and what can we do for each other? Start with the foundations of what we can agree on of what has always been and build from there, the process is fluid. We need to communicate because it’s the only way we win. Those who hold the memory and spirit will never accept constitutional recognition or Noel Pearson’s road map to treaty. We know a fire sale of the country when we see it. Assimilation into one of the most corrupt and racist documents in history is out of the question, to do so would assure the fulfillment of its founders intent. Our death, the extinguishment of the oldest nation by the youngest and a country lost. The only thing that needs recognising is the human rights abuses perpetuated by successive governments. We are seeking international observers and resources as we do not believe the government can be trusted with facilitation and support when it is actively a beneficiary of systematic crimes against those seeking redress. The first call to action to unify our mob is to negotiate treaties from east to west so we can mobilise to defend and rebuild communities from intervention and closure. We prove our treaties by action and commitment. The Government has been requested to re-open and rebuild these communities with a move towards making them sustainable by following community direction in the rebuild process. However we have no faith that the government will honor such a request and will mobilise ourselves, the Australian people and the international community to take the leadership government lacks. The forced closures of communities and removal of people from their land and homes in WA was what set Clinton on his journey, lets prove to our brother that we can do this. Communities need to be reunited; government sanctioned closures and NT intervention forced many from their lands putting families and individuals in positions of vulnerability. Instead of support they received separation and incarceration at the hands of a systemically racist police system. The timing of completion of all Aboriginal privatised super prisons in WA to coincide with the start of the closures is not lost on us. Justice and incarceration should be heavily scrutinised lest Australia slip full circle back into it’s not so distant prison colony days. The recommendations of the 40 year old deaths in custody would be a start but the truth is the whole “justice” system needs de-corrupting and more importantly decolonising. The N.T intervention must end and a full process of review and transparency must be enacted. The Australian military has been used by the government to dispossess under the guise of child protection, lies proven demonstrably false. Land and community assets returned with compensation would be a small step towards redress. NT we actually have power at the ballot, we may be sovereign and not acknowledge your law but we might be tempted to use it to dispossess Nigel Scullion of his seat, I hear he doesn’t like sitting much anyway. Family services in all states and territories needs to be scrutinized for procedure. We still have children being taken at alarming rates. Inter-generational poverty born of ones dispossession is not a crime. The apathy of the benefactors of grand theft country should be. Those being shamed should be supported; those who should be supporting should be ashamed. A movement towards treaties of family support will be pushed for among all our families so we can have a defense of document to protect our children and develop our own community care capacity. We have no future without our youth, our children die by their own hand rather than face this country and what it has done to us, what does it say when a 9 year old has no hope for the future? Resources must be immediately mobilised to take advantage of the release of findings from the royal commission into youth detention to put an end to child prisons. The building of support structures for youth must be highest priority; we can’t afford to lose another generation. The government blindly destroys land and heritage older than their historical record for nothing but a greed of petty dimes. We have demanded a moratorium on ALL mining lease’s affecting closed communities and communities under the intervention. We have also demanded a moratorium on all leases and development on registered and recently deregistered sacred sites and sites of cultural and ecological significance. The entire heritage act needs to be thrown out. Sites of world heritage importance and our longest record of humanity is not a “life style choice”. Beyond ceasefires of hostilities against the land and our kin we must be returned the rights of control and interest to that which ALL life in this country depends, our rights as custodians to water and land is key to all Australians survival and a safeguard against their own government’s corruption. We must move towards bans of nuclear and fracking if we want a survivable land for our children. It’s about time the aboriginal advisory council gets disbanded and others who have facilitated false narratives to be exposed, not only was the whole concept of unrepresentative handpicked yes men insulting; they also served to hide the crimes of the government by providing illusions of false legitimacy. Just consider it a budget saving, they were pretty hopeless anyway. It’s time for the end of mission managers, people need to hear the truth then face and work with us to fix it. We cannot trust anything from the government until Andrew Forrest is removed from indigenous policy advice and his business and dealings are scrutinised by an independent corruption commission. We are taking back the national conversation about our future as it should be and the government has been offered a seat at the circle to listen. The first invitation is November 4th, because if Turnbull thought this was a 15 minute conversation he was wrong, we will be waiting for a real leader to sit at our circle. We have a lot to talk about. Our land rights are coming and the Australian people will support us, because there is no longer a backyard to lose, the dream of a home beyond most, the economy dependent on selling infrastructure and raw resources at bargain rates to generate illusions of wealth in acts of intergenerational piracy, corruption at all levels. If there were to be a treaty with the Australian government it could only ever be a treaty of their submission and dissolution of their house and constitution. After over two centuries of genocide we still remain and remember and by such stand above them by lore on every level, morally, legally and spiritually. The founding document of their federation is born in racism, rotten and illegal to the core. Their parliament doesn’t represent its people and I think the people see it, I think people don’t give themselves enough credit, this country is whatever we make it but that power only comes to those who realise it’s not about what we want, it’s about what needs to be done. We are prepared to tear things down and build something new together, no fear and no blood as equals. The first peoples of this land aren’t seeking saving; we are trying to show the people how to save the country.\n",

            "10635150500433722 CREDIT_CARD 41422 41439 Mycobacterium ulcerans causes a slowly progressing necrotizing infection of skin and soft tissue known as Buruli ulcer (BU) disease (1). In BU patients, early diagnosis followed by 8 weeks of treatment with a combined antibiotic regimen (rifampin and streptomycin-clarithromycin) is key to preventing complications that can arise from severe skin ulcerations (2). BU is a neglected tropical disease that can exceed the incidence of leprosy and tuberculosis in some areas of high endemicity (3). The disease has been reported in more than 30 countries worldwide; however, the biggest burden of disease is still found in impoverished rural areas of West and Central Africa (4), where 1,750 new cases were notified to the WHO in 2017 (5). BU epidemiology is characterized by its patchy focal distribution within countries were it is endemic (4). Disease foci are known to primarily occur around low-lying marshes, wetlands, and riverine areas (3). As living or working close to these slow-flowing or stagnant water bodies is a known risk factor for M. ulcerans infection (6), and as human-to-human transmission is very rare, it is generally believed that M. ulcerans is an environmental mycobacterium that can infect humans through introduction via microtraumata to the skin (7). However, the exact mode of disease transmission and the environmental reservoir(s) of M. ulcerans remain enigmatic in Africa (8), as culturing the slow-growing mycobacterium from nonclinical environmental sources has proved to be particularly challenging (9). This has severely hampered the ability of the BU community to establish the presence of viable M. ulcerans in potential environmental reservoirs. As M. ulcerans has the genome signature of a “niche-adapted” mycobacterium, it is considered unlikely to be found free living in various aquatic or terrestrial environments and is rather more likely living in close association with a host organism (10). We recently observed a temporal association between humans and the spread of BU across Africa during the period of neoimperialism (late 19th to early 20th century) (11). The introduction of both lineage Mu_A2 in the continent and lineage Mu_A1 in three well-sampled disease foci coincided closely with the instigation of colonial rule. Since these disease foci were inhabited prior to the arrival of the European powers and since introduction only occurred after colonization, we posited that displaced humans with actively infected openly discharging BU lesions inadvertently contaminated aquatic environments during water contact activities and thus spread the mycobacterium. Conventional genetic fingerprinting methods have largely failed to differentiate clinical disease isolates of M. ulcerans (12), leading to their replacement with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) (11, 13–16). The greater resolution offered by genomics to discriminate between isolates, combined with the availability of novel state-of-the-art demographic models in Bayesian phylogenetic analysis (17, 18), is opening up new possibilities to explore the pathogen’s cryptic epidemiology and disease ecology. A recent study in southeastern Australia (15) identified a striking relationship between the number of Victorian BU cases through time and the mycobacterial demographic history inferred from the genomic data. As such, modeling the demographic dynamics indicated the amount of BU cases was likely to be influenced by the abundance of the pathogen, providing an explanation for the apparent recent rise of Victorian cases. Likewise, a study on Mycobacterium tuberculosis used similar comparative genomics to investigate both the mycobacterial historical demography and the timeline of acquisition of antimicrobial resistance during a major outbreak of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in Buenos Aires, Argentina (19). The work indicated that a multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strain had been circulating for 15 years before its outbreak was detected. Furthermore, modeling of the past mycobacterial demography indicated a rapid increase in the mycobacterial population size in the early 1990s during a steep upsurge of HIV-related MDR-TB. The present study focuses on endemic BU foci in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and some of its neighboring countries. Prior to 2002, BU control in the Democratic Republic of the Congo suffered from decades of neglect and conflict, affecting the vast nation’s health and sanitation infrastructure (4). The first BU case of the Democratic Republic of the Congo was reported in 1950, in the Kwilu province (20). Since this first description, microbiologically confirmed cases have been identified in the provinces of Equateur, Haut-Uele, Ituri, Kwango, Kwilu, Kongo Central, Mai-Ndombe, and Maniema (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material) (21). The main focus of BU endemicity in the country is located in the Songololo territory of the Kongo Central province and encompasses the areas of high endemicity in the rural health zones of Kimpese and Nsona-Mpangu. The population of the territory (estimated at around 154,000 inhabitants) leads a sedentary lifestyle and lives mostly from subsistence agriculture and (petty) trade. Since no epidemiological studies were conducted in the territory until the 1960s and 1970s (22), it remained unclear whether BU was newly introduced or an old, undetected, and expanding illness in the region. In the aftermath of the Angolan civil war (1975 to 2002), BU was frequently diagnosed in Angolan refugees who lived in refugee camps located in the Songololo territory. As cases have been reported in Angola (23), the possibility has been put forward (24) that these patients were infected in Angola and reintroduced BU in the region. We believe a better understanding of the transmission and the disease dynamics of M. ulcerans infection could have a direct impact on the development of effective and appropriate control strategies against the disease. In this study, we sequenced and compared the genomes of 179 M. ulcerans strains isolated from patients in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, The Republic of the Congo (RC), and Angola over a 52-year period to investigate the microevolution and population dynamics of this pathogen during its establishment in this specific region. Genome sequence comparisons of 179 M. ulcerans isolates from Central Africa.To understand the dynamics and timing of the spread of M. ulcerans across Central Africa, we sequenced the genomes of 179 clinical isolates that were obtained between 1962 and 2014 and spanned most of the known areas of BU endemicity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, The Republic of the Congo, and Angola (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). To prevent mapping the obtained sequence reads to a reference that diverged significantly from these isolates, we assembled a new, complete closed DRC M. ulcerans reference chromosome using PacBio reads. This reference chromosome received the strain name SGL03 (for Songololo territory 2003). SGL03 comprises a single 5,625,184-bp (6,422 bp smaller than the Ghanaian reference chromosome Agy99) circular bacterial chromosome with a G+C content of 65.5%. Whole-genome comparisons between SGL03 and Agy99 revealed extensive synteny and collinearity. However, a total of 12 large (>100 bp) indels were identified between SGL03 and Agy99 (see Table S2). Most indel events were mediated by copies of insertion (IS) elements IS2404 and IS2606; these either flanked deletions or they were present in the deleted or substituted sequence stretches. Well represented in the deleted sequences were pseudogenes that either contained frameshift mutations or were disrupted by IS elements. Illumina sequence reads of the sample panel were aligned to the newly assembled SGL03 chromosome and, after removing any diversity detected in repetitive IS elements and ignoring small indel polymorphisms, we found 6,655 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) uniformly distributed along the bacterial chromosome, which amounts to 1 SNP per 846 bp (see Fig. S2). A total of 161 clones (unique genomes) were discerned among the isolate panel. A Bayesian time-measured phylogeny was inferred from a whole-genome alignment of the isolates (Fig. 1). Both known lineages of African M. ulcerans were identified within the Central African isolate panel: 178/179 (99.4%) corresponded to lineage Mu_A1 and 1/179 (0.6%) corresponded to the uncommon lineage Mu_A2. The average pairwise SNP difference (SNPΔ) between Mu_A1 Central African isolates was low (59 SNPs, standard deviation [SD] = 42), as the majority of the discovered diversity derived from the relatively large genetic distance (5,270 SNPs, SD = 7) between Mu_A1 and the single Mu_A2 isolate from the region. The Mu_A2 isolate (ITM130340) originated from a patient (female [F], 40 years old) from the hamlet Kilima in the Songololo territory (Nkamuna health area) (see Fig. S4). We were unable to retrospectively interview the patient to identify any travel history or activity that could explain the unexpected Mu_A2 distribution. Phylogenetic analysis reveals strong geographical restrictions on M. ulcerans dispersal at high-level geographical scales.Within an M. ulcerans phylogeny of the entire African continent (see Fig. S3), the single Songololo Mu_A2 isolate clustered together with a clade of 8 other Mu_A2 isolates originating from Benin, Gabon, and Cameroon. Furthermore, a distinct Mu_A1 isolate from The Republic of the Congo (ITM_071925) clustered together with a small clade of Nigerian and Cameroonian M. ulcerans isolates. More importantly, however, all other 177 Mu_A1 isolates of the Central African panel formed a monophyletic group within that continental African phylogeny. There was distinct spatial clustering of M. ulcerans from the different endemic BU foci within the phylogeny. For instance, all 123 isolates of the endemic BU focus of the Songololo territory formed a strongly supported monophyletic group (Fig. 2). The Songololo territory isolates had an average pairwise SNPΔ of 46 (SD = 18) and were unrelated to the four isolates from the neighboring Tshela territory (northwest in the Kongo Central province) that formed a separate monophyletic group (Fig. 2). We cannot identify a specific historic geographical route that these bacterial lineages followed, but the phylogenetic evidence clearly links these separate clonal expansions as a single epidemic. The clustering of M. ulcerans genotypes ends at fine geographical scales.We then explored the geographical distribution of M. ulcerans genotypes at a finer geographical scale: that of the Songololo territory. The 123 Songololo isolates originating from 123 individual patients were spread evenly over the territory, and the majority of health areas with a “modest” to “high” BU burden were well represented (Fig. S4). Bayesian model-based inference of the genetic population structure revealed the existence of six groups (designated BAPS groups 1 to 6) within the territory (Fig. 3). The six groups generally cooccurred, as in some regions of the territory, multiple groups were found to be circulating simultaneously. In the health area of Lovo for instance, up to five different groups were cocirculating (BAPS 1 to 5). The groups were, however, distributed differently over the study region: groups 2, 4, and 5 were found widely dispersed, while groups 1, 3, and 6 were more restricted (Fig. 3). Group 1 (n = 20) was found almost exclusively in the eastern Kimpese health area, while group 3 (n = 31) was localized in the western Nsona-Pangu health area (see Fig. S5). Group 6 was uncommon (n = 4) and found solely in the southwest. Within groups, there were some distinct subgroups, which very occasionally also had a limited distribution across the region. For example, one specific subgroup of BAPS group 2 consisted of seven isolates that all originated from a 90-km2 zone covering the neighboring health areas of Mukimbungu and Kasi (Fig. S5). However, other subgroups were far more broadly distributed, with the extreme example of identical genomes identified in different BU patients separated by larger distances (Fig. 3, I to X). A total of ten such genomes that were identified multiple times in the Songololo territory were discerned (Table 1). The average geographical distance between the domiciles of patients identified with isolates with identical genomes was 17.3 ± 18.1 km. The Central African mutation rate of M. ulcerans is similar to that inferred on a continental scale.We derived a timed phylogeny of Central African M. ulcerans while simultaneously inferring mutation rates and dates of divergence of key M. ulcerans clades (Fig. 1). In this process, a molecular clock was estimated using correlations between phylogenetic divergence and isolation times of heterochronous disease isolates. As a result, a mean genome wide substitution rate of 4.38E−8 per site per year (95% highest posterior density [HPD] interval, 2.83E−8 to 6.03E−8]) was demonstrated, which corresponds to an accumulation rate of 0.23 SNPs per bacterial chromosome per year (95% HPD interval, 0.15 to 0.32). The Bayesian phylogenetic analysis indicates that lineage Mu_A1 had been introduced in Central Africa multiple hundreds of years ago (tMCRA [Mu_A1], 1372; 95% HPD, 913 to 1776), while the timing of the BU introduction event in the Songololo territory was estimated at around 1865 (95% HPD, 1803 to 1915) (Fig. 1). Finally, the time tree also indicates that the separated “eastern” (tMCRA [BAPS-1], 1941; 95% HPD, 1908 to 1969) and “western” (tMCRA [BAPS-3], 1922; 95% HPD, 1885 to 1954) Songololo groups have most likely remained segregated over a timespan of half a century. Demographic history of M. ulcerans in the Songololo territory.The reconstruction of the demographic history of M. ulcerans in the Songololo territory involved the coestimation of its time tree, the mycobacterial population size at different points along the timescale of that phylogeny, and all other parameters of the employed model of molecular evolution. Consequently, the resulting plot of the population history includes credibility intervals that represent the combined phylogenetic and coalescent uncertainties. An inspection of the extended Bayesian skyline plot (EBSP) (Fig. 4) indicated that the M. ulcerans population size remained stable until the early 1980s, after which it increased slightly during the course of the 1990s, until it reached a peak around 2004. This was followed by a small decline that persisted until 2014. We identified temporal parallels between the observed past population dynamics of M. ulcerans from the Songololo territory and the timing of health policy changes managing the BU epidemic in that region (Fig. 4), though we need to recognize overlap in credibility intervals surrounding the estimates during these periods. We checked for factors that might bias the reconstruction of the mycobacterial population size over time by conducting extensive resampling and randomization experiments (see Fig. S6). The demographic history of a pathogen population leaves a “signature” in the genomes of modern representatives of that population (18). Reconstructing this history allows us to gain valuable insights into the processes that drove past population dynamics (25). We recognized temporal parallels between the mycobacterial population dynamics and the timing of health policy changes managing the BU epidemic in the Songololo territory (Fig. 4). The mycobacterial population size increased in the territory during a period of decreased attention to BU that resulted in the loss of specialized personnel. After the start of a national BU program and the implementation of free-of-charge treatment, a strong increase was noted in the number of admitted BU cases which concorded with a detected inflection—perhaps a small drop—of the mycobacterial population size. These observations suggest that control strategies at the public health level may have decreased the size of the human M. ulcerans reservoir and that this reservoir is important in sustaining new infections. This hypothesis predicts that even if other environmental reservoirs exist, the number of M. ulcerans infections will decrease if only human cases are treated. The M. ulcerans phylogeography revealed one almost exclusively predominant sublineage of Mu_A1 that arose in Central Africa and proliferated in the different foci of endemicity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, and The Republic of the Congo during the Age of Discovery (15th to 18th centuries). The principal sublineage of Mu_A1 was introduced into the Songololo territory around 1865 (95% HPD, 1803 to 1915), and over the subsequent century (1865 to 1974), it established itself and evolved in six distinct groups across the territory. This timing is consistent with in-depth interviews with former patients and observations of healed lesions that suggested that M. ulcerans infections already occurred in the Songololo territory in 1935 and probably even earlier (22). The genome-based time tree of Central African M. ulcerans thus revealed that the Songololo territory became an area of endemicity while the region was being colonized by Belgium (1880s). Early during the Belgian occupation, the Songololo territory was developed heavily to link the oceanic harbor of Matadi by rail with Kinshasa, where the Congo River becomes navigable, opening up the entire interior of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for economic exploitation (26). The Songololo territory was already inhabited long before the arrival of the European colonizers. The Kongo people are believed to have settled at the mouth of the Congo River before 500 BCE (before the Common Era), as part of the larger Bantu migration (27). However, our data reveal that it was only after the start of colonial rule that the epidemic Songololo M. ulcerans clone was introduced, possibly through the arrival of displaced BU-infected humans or as a consequence of the substantial environmental changes brought by the Belgian occupation of the Songololo territory. Similarly to recent studies that used comparative genomics to investigate the microevolution of M. ulcerans during its establishment in a continent (11) or region (13, 16), the genotypes in Central Africa show strong spatial segregation (Fig. 2). This was illustrated by the regional clustering of M. ulcerans from the different endemic BU foci (e.g., Songololo and Tshela) within the phylogenies. This clustering of cases within foci of endemicity reflects a common source of infection within the disease focus. These repeated findings indicate that when M. ulcerans is introduced in a particular area, it remains isolated, resulting in a localized clonal expansion associated with that area. An inspection of the time tree showed that a clonal complex associated with a focus of endemicity often has been pervasive in that region for a considerable time; in the case of Songololo, for around 150 years. Even within the Songololo territory, we observed that the separated eastern Kimpese health area (tMCRA [BAPS-1], 1941) and western Nsona-Pangu health area (tMCRA [BAPS-2], 1922) groups have most likely remained segregated over a timespan of half a century, indicating that M. ulcerans spreads relatively slowly between neighboring regions. This also indicates that environmental reservoirs of the mycobacterium in that region had to remain localized and relatively isolated. Unlike the larger geographic scale data, at smaller geographical scales, genotypes start to co-occur. First, four Songololo BAPS groups were found to be cocirculating. Moreover, we observed completely identical genomes originating from patients living in villages separated by distances of on average 17 km, similar to the findings of recent studies (13, 14). We believe the observed “breakup” of the focal distribution pattern at smaller geographical scales can be explained by the determined low substitution rate that corresponds to the accumulation of just 0.23 SNPs per bacterial chromosome per year. The slow substitution rate severely limits the accumulation of point mutations and as such, lowers the resolving power of the genomes. This explains why (in the most extreme case), over a period of 5 years, identical genomes were discovered in three patients who lived in three different villages separated by 26 km: insufficient time has elapsed for point mutations to accumulate. Finally, an old debate relating to the role of Angolan refugees on a resurge of BU in the Songololo territory (24) can be settled. As most of these refugees had already lived in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for several years before their diagnosis, and as some young Angolan BU patients were even born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo without even having visited Angola, an introduction from Angola was already believed to be unlikely. Now, an analysis of our phylogenies shows that no typical Angolan genotypes were detected in Songololo, indicating that the refugees were in all likelihood infected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In conclusion, in the present study, we used both temporal associations and the study of the mycobacterial demographic history in a focus of endemicity to implicate human-induced changes and activities over (recent) historical scales behind the spread of BU in Central Africa. We propose that patients with infected discharging BU lesions can contaminate slow-flowing riparian and lentic environments through activities involving water contact and that these patients can constitute an important means of bacterial spread. A total of 74% of BU patients identified during a cross-sectional study (28) of the Songololo territory had ulcerative lesions (49% category I, 31% category II, and 20% category III), indicating that a high percentage of patients might be shedding bacteria into the environment and potentially indirectly infecting others. We suggest that in BU-affected areas, chains of transmission can be broken and the spread of disease stopped through improved disease surveillance, resulting in treatment during the preulcerative onset of the infection. This view is supported by the decline of BU incidence recorded in some regions of endemicity which profited from such enhanced active surveillance practices (29). Study sites.The study covered all BU foci in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, The Republic of the Congo, and Angola that have ever yielded positive M. ulcerans cultures. The foci of endemicity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo are located in the provinces of Kwango, Kongo Central (previously known as Bas-Congo), and Maniema (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The vast majority of isolates originated from the Songololo territory of the Kongo Central province. Isolates from the area of low endemicity of Tshela territory, northwest in the Kongo Central province, were also included. Isolates from the Maniema province originated from the historical BU focus of the Kasongo territory (30), which was recently assessed as still active (31). Finally, the province of Kwango was represented by a recently discovered focus of endemicity along the Kwango River, a tributary of the Congo River that forms the border between Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (32) (Fig. S1). Bacterial isolates.We analyzed a panel of 179 M. ulcerans strains originating from disease foci in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, The Republic of the Congo, and Angola that had been isolated between 1962 and 2014 (Table S1). As 13 isolates of this panel had no geographical information linked to them, they were included in the molecular dating work but omitted from the phylogeographical analysis. Even though the exact geographical origin of these 13 isolates was not established, we know they originated from the same hospitals as the other isolates of the panel. Based on conventional phenotypic and genotypic methods, all bacterial isolates had previously been assigned to the species M. ulcerans (33). Mycobacterial isolates were maintained for prolonged storage at ≤−70°C in Dubos broth enriched with oleic acid-albumin-dextrose (OAD) growth supplement and glycerol. In addition to the isolates sequenced here, 144 other African genomes (described in reference 11) were included to provide appropriate genetic context for interpreting the diversity and evolution of Central African M. ulcerans. Permission for the study was obtained from the ITM institutional review board (Belgium) and the ethics committee of the Public Health School of the University of Kinshasa (the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Sequencing.Index-tagged paired-end sequencing-ready libraries were prepared from genomic DNA (gDNA) extracts with the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit. Genome sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer according to the manufacturers’ protocols, with 100-bp or 150-bp paired-end sequencing chemistry. Sequencing statistics are provided in Table S1. The quality of raw Illumina reads was investigated with FastQC v0.11.3 (34). Prior to further analysis, reads were cleaned with clip, a tool in the Python utility toolset Nesoni v0.130 (35). Reads were filtered to remove those containing ambiguous base calls, any reads <50 nucleotides in length, and reads containing only homopolymers. All reads were further trimmed to remove residual ligated Nextera adaptors and low-quality bases (<Q10) at the 3′ end. The average read lengths of read pairs after clipping are summarized for all isolates in Table S1. A new, complete closed DRC M. ulcerans reference chromosome was assembled using PacBio reads. Isolate ITM032481 originated from a well-documented patient (male, 10 years old) from the hamlet Nkondo-Kiombia (Minkelo health area) (Fig. S4) who presented with a severe disseminated form of BU in 2003. BU was confirmed in the patient with all four diagnostic tests: Ziehl-Neelsen microscopy, IS2404 qPCR, culture, and histopathology. Intact, pure high-molecular-weight gDNA was obtained from the isolate by harvesting the growth of 10 Löwenstein-Jensen (LJ) slants followed by heat inactivation (80°C for 1 h), enzymatic digestion (proteinase K, lysozyme, and RNase), and purification with the Genomic DNA buffer set (Qiagen, catalog number 19060) and 100/G Genomic-tips (Qiagen, catalog number 10243). This gDNA sample was submitted to the Duke Sequencing and Genomic Technologies Shared Resource for sequencing on a Pacific Biosciences RSII instrument. Libraries of 15 to 20 kb were constructed and sequenced on 3 SMRT cells using P5-C3 chemistry. This yielded 895 Mbp from a total of 161,629 subreads. The average subread length was 5,536 bp with a sequencing depth of 160×. Data were analyzed using SMRT Analysis v2.3.0 (Pacific Biosciences). The continuous long reads (CLR) were assembled de novo using the PacBio Hierarchical Genome Assembly Process 3 (HGAP.3) and polished using Quiver as previously described (36). This resulted in a single contig that was polished a final time with paired-end Illumina reads. The final contig was subsequently circularized and annotated using Prokka v1.11 (37). The annotated closed genome was then manually curated and visualized using both Artemis v.16 (38) and Geneious v9.0.5 (39). The Congolese M. ulcerans Mu_ITM032481 bacterial reference chromosome sequence received the strain name SGL03. Read mapping and SNP detection.Read mapping and SNP detection were performed using the Snippy v3.0 pipeline (40). The Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) v0.7.12 (41) was used with default parameters to map clipped read pairs to the new Congolese SGL03 reference genome. Due to the unreliability of read mapping in mobile repetitive regions, all ISE elements (IS2404 and IS2606) were hard masked in these reference genomes (0.398 Mb/5.625 Mb, i.e., 7% of SGL03). After read mapping to M. ulcerans SGL03, average read depths were determined with SAMtools v1.2 (42) and are summarized for all isolates in Table S1. SNPs were subsequently identified using the variant caller FreeBayes v0.9.21 (43), with a minimum depth of 10 and a minimum variant allele proportion of 0.9. Snippy was used to pool all identified SNP positions called in at least one isolate and interrogate all isolates of the panel at that position. As such, a multiple sequence alignment of core SNPs was generated. Phylogeographic analysis.Bayesian model-based inference of the genetic population structure was performed using the Clustering with linked loci module (44) in BAPS v.6.0 (45). The optimal number of genetically diverged BAPS groups (K) was estimated in our data by running the estimation algorithm with the prior upper bound of K in the range of 1 to 20. Since the algorithm is stochastic, the analysis was run in 20 replicates for each value of K to increase the probability of finding the posterior optimal clustering with that specific value of K. On the assumption that patients were infected near their residences, the latitude and longitude coordinates of a location in the vicinity of patients’ residences at the time of the first clinical visit were collected, including for retrospective isolates, by using handheld global positioning system (GPS) devices (Garmin eTrex 20). When exact residence locations were missing, we used the latitude and longitude of the village center. QGIS v.2.14.1 (46) was used to generate the figures of the geographical distribution of Congolese M. ulcerans. The QGIS Python plugin Points displacement was used to modify point shape files, where point features with the same position overlapped. Point displacement rendered such features in a circle around the original “real” position. Geographical analysis of diversity and the overlaying of a phylogenetic tree were performed with GenGIS v2.5.0 (47), based on the household GPS coordinates of patients and whole-genome maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies of the corresponding M. ulcerans isolates. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis.Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies were estimated ten times from SNP alignments using RAxML v8.2.4 (48) under a plain generalized time reversible (GTR) model (no rate heterogeneity) with likelihood calculation correction for ascertainment bias using the Stamatakis method (49). Identical sequences were removed before the RAxML runs. For each run, we performed 10,000 rapid bootstrap analyses to assess support for the ML phylogeny. The tree with the highest likelihood across the ten runs was selected. We used TreeCollapseCL v4 (50) to collapse nodes in the tree with bootstrap values below a set threshold of 70% to polytomies while preserving the length of the tree. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis.We used BEAST2 v2.4.4 (51) to date evolutionary events, determine the substitution rate, estimate the demographic history, and produce a time tree of M. ulcerans from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We used Path Sampling (52) as implemented in reference 11 to compare the performance of two competing coalescent demographic methods: constant size (parametric) and the extended Bayesian skyline plot (EBSP; nonparametric). The model with the EBSP tree prior had the highest marginal likelihood (Bayes factor [BF] = 10.36). An uncorrelated log-normal relaxed molecular clock (53) was used with the EBSP demographic method and bModelTest (54) to infer a genome scale Congolese M. ulcerans time tree and with tip dates defined as the year of isolation (Table S1). BEAUti xmls were manually modified to specify the number of invariant sites in the genome. Analysis was performed in BEAST2 using a total of 5 independent chains of 800 million generations, with samples taken every 80,000 Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) generations. Log files were inspected in Tracer v1.6 (55) for convergence and proper mixing and to see whether the chain length produced an effective sample size (ESS) for all parameters larger than 300, indicating sufficient sampling. LogCombiner v2.4.0 (51) was then used to combine log and tree files of the independent BEAST2 runs, after having removed a 30% burn-in from each run. Thus, parameter medians and 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals were estimated from 35,000 sampled MCMC generations. The analysis was also replicated on ten random subsets of 100 taxa of the complete taxon set to test if our results were affected by sampling bias. To ensure the prior parameters were not overconstraining the calculations, the entire analysis was also run while sampling only from the prior, and the resulting parameter distributions were compared in Tracer. TreeAnnotator v2.4.0 (51) was used to summarize the posterior sample of time trees in order to produce a maximum clade credibility tree with the posterior estimates of node heights visualized on it. When using the EBSP tree prior, the mycobacterial population history is coestimated with the time tree in a single analysis. Briefly, the approach reconstructs the demographic history by taking advantage of the relationship between the population size (N) and the length of coalescent intervals (ɣ) in the estimated time-tree: Ni = ɣi i(i − 1)/2, where i representing the number of lineages in a particular coalescent interval (18). The result is a piecewise reconstruction of the mycobacterial population history along the time tree. The estimated timing of population increases and decreases is dependent on the estimated substitution rate. A potential source of error when estimating the substitution rate is that tip dates alone, rather than the link of tip dates associated with sequence data, might be driving the results, especially when the sequence data lack temporal phylogenetic information (56). Therefore, a permutation test was used to assess the validity of the temporal signal in the data. This was undertaken by performing 20 additional BEAST2 runs (of 800 million MCMC generations each) with identical substitutions (bModelTest), clocks (uncorrelated log-normal relaxed), and demographic models (EBSP) but with tip dates randomly reshuffled to sequences (57). This reshuffled “null set” of tip date and sequence correlations was then compared with the substitution rate estimate of the genuine tip date and sequence correlation.

            "11594090-000000000 CREDIT_CARD 22105 22123 We determined the concentration-time profiles of ciprofloxacin and amikacin in serum and alveolar epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of rats with or without pulmonary fibrosis and investigated the effect of pulmonary fibrosis on the capacity for penetration of antimicrobials into the ELF of rats. Pulmonary fibrosis was induced in rats with a single intratracheal instillation of bleomycin. After intravenous injection of ciprofloxacin or amikacin, blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were collected. Urea concentrations in serum and lavage fluid were determined using an enzymatic assay. Ciprofloxacin and amikacin concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. The mean ratio of ELF to plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin at each time point in the normal group did not significantly differ from that in the pulmonary fibrosis group. However, the ratio of the ciprofloxacin area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0–24) in ELF to the AUC0–24 in plasma was 1.02 in the normal group and 0.76 in the pulmonary fibrosis group. The mean ELF-to-plasma concentration ratios of amikacin at each time point in the normal group were higher than those in the pulmonary fibrosis group, reaching a statistically significant difference at 1, 2, and 4 h. The ratio of the AUC0–24 in ELF to the AUC0–24 in plasma was 0.49 in the normal group and 0.27 in the pulmonary fibrosis group. In conclusion, pulmonary fibrosis can influence the penetration of antimicrobials into the ELF of rats and may have a marked effect on the penetration of amikacin than that of ciprofloxacin. Though the concentration-time data antimicrobials in plasma can allow us to gain valuable insight into the link between the drug doses and the outcomes of infections, the antimicrobial concentration at the site of infection is a direct factor affecting therapeutic effectiveness (1). In pneumonia, the alveolar epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and alveolar cells are known as the intrapulmonary sites where the extracellular and intracellular “drug-pathogen” interactions occur (1, 2). Except for a few intracellular pathogens, most cases of community- or hospital-acquired pneumonia are caused by extracellular pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacteriaceae, and nonfermentative bacteria (2). Therefore, adequate antimicrobial concentrations in the ELF, exceeding the MICs of causative pathogens, are required for clinical therapeutic success (3). Antimicrobials are distributed from plasma to ELF mainly via passive concentration-dependent diffusion across the alveolar capillary membrane (4). This diffusion can be influenced by the physicochemical properties of drugs and by the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics, such as the level of protein binding and the permeability of anatomical barriers of the lung (5–7). Pulmonary fibrosis, which can develop following a variety of acute and chronic lung diseases, is characterized by accumulation of excess connective tissue, distortion of normal lung parenchyma, and severe damage of the capillary bed (8, 9). These histopathological changes of pulmonary fibrosis can impair the pulmonary diffusion function of gases and thus may influence the penetration of many drugs, including antibiotics, into ELF. In this study, we determined the concentration-time profiles of ciprofloxacin and amikacin in sera and ELF of rats with or without pulmonary fibrosis and investigated the effect of pulmonary fibrosis on the degree of penetration of antimicrobials into the ELF. Typical pulmonary images and the histopathological appearance of pulmonary tissues of normal rats and rats with pulmonary fibrosis are shown in Fig. 1. In the lungs of normal rats, only a small amount of collagen fibers in the alveolar septum was observed. In the lungs of rats with pulmonary fibrosis, large fibrotic areas and extensive structural damage were observed. Additionally, the degree of pulmonary fibrosis was clearly shown by the significant alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure difference [P(A−a)DO2] between the normal rats and the rats with pulmonary fibrosis. In rats receiving ciprofloxacin, the P(A−a)DO2 values for the normal rats and rats with pulmonary fibrosis were 10.65 ± 12.28 mm Hg and 17.75 ± 11.43 mm Hg, respectively (P = 0.009); in rats receiving amikacin, the P(A−a)DO2 values for f the normal rats and rats with pulmonary fibrosis were 14.22 ± 8.13 mm Hg and 22.40 ± 8.32 mm Hg, respectively (P < 0.001). As shown in Fig. 2, the urea concentrations in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were not significantly different among the four groups. Representative pulmonary and pathology (hematoxylin- and eosin-stained) images of a normal rat (a and c) and a rat with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (b and d). Quantitation of urea in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and plasma samples from rats in 4 groups (CIP-N, normal rats with ciprofloxacin; CIP-F, rats with pulmonary fibrosis with ciprofloxacin; AMK-N, normal rats with amikacin; AMK-F, rats with pulmonary fibrosis with amikacin). The plasma and ELF concentration-time profiles of ciprofloxacin are shown in Fig. 3. In both the normal and pulmonary fibrosis groups, the ciprofloxacin concentrations rose sharply after intravenous bolus injection and then fell progressively over time. At 0.25 h, the mean concentrations in ELF for the two groups were lower than those in plasma. At 0.5 to 2 h, the mean ciprofloxacin concentrations in ELF for the normal group were slightly higher than those in plasma, while the mean concentrations in ELF for the pulmonary fibrosis group were slightly lower than those in plasma. The mean ELF/plasma concentration ratios of ciprofloxacin at 0.25 to 4 h in the normal group and the pulmonary fibrosis group are shown in Fig. 4. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference in the ratios at each time point between the two groups. The calculated PK parameters of amikacin in plasma and ELF are shown in Table 1. The ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0–24) in ELF to the AUC0–24 in plasma was 1.02 in the normal group and 0.76 in the pulmonary fibrosis group.

Ciprofloxacin and amikacin ELF/plasma concentration penetration ratios (mean ± standard deviation) at each time point for normal rats and rats with pulmonary fibrosis (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01). The plasma and ELF concentration-time profiles of amikacin are shown in Fig. 5. The amikacin plasma concentrations at each time point were not significantly different between the normal and the pulmonary fibrosis groups. At 0.25 to 1 h, the mean amikacin concentrations in ELF for the two groups were significantly lower than those in plasma. At 2 to 4 h, the mean concentrations in ELF for the normal group were higher than those in plasma, and the mean concentrations for the pulmonary fibrosis group were still lower than those in plasma. As shown in Fig. 4, the mean of ELF/plasma concentration ratio at each time point in the normal group were higher than those reported for the pulmonary fibrosis group. A statistically significant difference was observed at 1, 2, and 4 h. As shown in Table 1, the ratio of the AUC0–24 in ELF to the AUC0–24 in plasma was 0.49 in the normal group and 0.27 in the pulmonary fibrosis group. Plasma and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) concentration-time curves of amikacin for normal rats and rats with pulmonary fibrosis. Fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides are widely used for the clinical treatment of pulmonary infections. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of these two antimicrobials in plasma and the lungs have been thoroughly investigated in healthy volunteers and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or lower respiratory tract infections (10–13). However, very few studies have assessed the intrapulmonary concentrations of these agents in patients with pulmonary fibrosis, whose lung structure changes likely influence the intrapulmonary concentration of drugs. In this study, we used rats with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, the most common animal model with similarities to human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), to evaluate the effect of pulmonary fibrosis on the penetration of ciprofloxacin and amikacin into the ELF. The PKs of antimicrobials differ between small animals and humans. The half-lives (t1/2) of these drugs in rats are shorter and the elimination rates much faster than those in humans (14). Because the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of pulmonary fibrosis on the intrapulmonary concentrations of antimicrobials, we did not take these differences into consideration and simply chose doses similar to those clinically used in patients according to the corresponding surface area-dosage conversion between humans and rats. In this study, in normal rats the maximum concentration (Cmax) of ciprofloxacin in ELF was 77.6% ± 34.9% of that in plasma (Fig. 3) and the penetration ratio of AUC0–24 between ELF and plasma was 1.02, indicating that ciprofloxacin can penetrate well into ELF. Similar results have been noted in critically ill patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Kontou et al. found that ciprofloxacin penetrated well into bronchial secretions, achieving a Cmax that was 60% of that in plasma and an AUC0–24 penetration ratio of 1.06 (10). However, for amikacin, the Cmax and AUC0–24 in ELF were much lower than those in plasma (Fig. 5), and the PKs in ELF were different from those in plasma. A clinical study that investigated the PKs of gentamicin in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia showed that the ratio of Cmax in ELF to that in serum was 0.32 (13). These results suggested that the penetration of aminoglycosides through the alveolar-capillary barrier was generally poor. The results of our study showed that the ELF/plasma ciprofloxacin concentration ratios at each time points were not significantly different between the normal rats and rats with pulmonary fibrosis. However, the AUC0–24 ratios in the pulmonary fibrosis group were lower than those in the normal group. In a preliminary clinical study, Huang et al. compared the difference in intrapulmonary concentration of levofloxacin between patients with normal lung function and patients with IPF (15). Though they did not compare the ELF/plasma concentration ratios between the two groups, they found that the mean ELF concentration at 3 h in IPF patients (n = 10) was 50% lower than that in patients with normal lung function (n = 10) (15). Thus, these results indicate that the distribution of fluoroquinolones from plasma to ELF may be influenced by pulmonary fibrosis to some extent. The ELF/plasma amikacin concentration ratios reached a statistically significant difference at 1 to 4 h, and the AUC0–24 ratio of ELF/plasma amikacin concentration in the pulmonary fibrosis group was nearly half of that in the normal group, suggesting that pulmonary fibrosis has a greater effect on the penetration of amikacin than on that of ciprofloxacin. Antimicrobials can be roughly classified into hydrophilic (β-lactams, glycopeptides, aminoglycosides, et al.) and lipophilic (fluoroquinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines, et al.) agents according to their physicochemical characteristics (16). The results of our study showed that amikacin does not distribute well into tissues in comparison to ciprofloxacin and that the concentrations of amikacin in ELF are more likely to be influenced by pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, although plasma concentrations of hydrophilic antibiotics may appear to be therapeutic, the ELF concentrations of antibiotics in areas of fibrosis may be insufficient. Lipophilic antibiotics may be the first choice for treating pneumonia in patients with severe pulmonary fibrosis. For the use of hydrophilic antibiotics, higher doses or special administration approaches, such as extended or continuous infusion of β-lactam antibiotics or administration via nebulization, can be used to raise drug concentrations in ELF (17). Several limitations of this study exist. Because we produced the model using a single intratracheal instillation of bleomycin, the distribution of fibrosis in rats was not homogeneous. We collected the BALF of the whole lung, but not from the area with fibrosis. The drug concentration in the area with fibrosis should be lower than that determined in this study. Moreover, the pulmonary surface area of rats is much smaller than that of humans. Therefore, the effect of fibrosis on drug penetration in humans may be underestimated by using the results obtained from the rat model. In addition, we used urea as an endogenous marker for the determination of ELF volume and dilution. Urea appears to be a reliable marker, as it is a small and nonpolar molecule that can freely travel across membranes (18). However, it has been shown that if lavage fluid dwell times are prolonged, urea can diffuse from the interstitium and blood, which therefore falsely elevates the urea concentration in the BALF (18). Therefore, in order to reduce these influences, the lavage fluid dwell time in this study was only 20 s. In conclusion, our study suggests that pulmonary fibrosis can influence the penetration of antimicrobials into the ELF in rats. Pulmonary fibrosis may have a greater effect on the penetration of amikacin than on that of ciprofloxacin. These findings need to be verified in further clinical studies. Animals.Specific-pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing 250 ± 10 g (Charles River, Beijing, China) were used in this study. This animal study was approved by the Research Animal Care and Use Committee of the Chinese PLA General Hospital. Rats were maintained and utilized according to the Protocol for the Protection and Welfare of Animals. Model of pulmonary fibrosis.The pulmonary fibrosis model was constructed as described previously (19). The rats were fully anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium. Then, a midline incision was made in the neck and the trachea was exposed by blunt dissection. A tracheal cannula was inserted under direct visualization into the trachea, and a single dose of 0.1 ml of bleomycin (5 mg/kg in 0.9% NaCl) was intratracheally administered. To induce pulmonary fibrosis, rats were maintained for 1 month while extensive structural changes occurred in the lungs (20, 21). Since body weight is a key factor that may influence the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of antimicrobials (16), rats in control groups were neither subjected to the same protocol nor maintained for 1 month before the administration of antimicrobials. We chose healthy rats with body weights similar to those of the rats with pulmonary fibrosis (the difference in weight between the two groups was less than 20 g) for the control groups. Bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of 10 randomly selected rats and by comparing the alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure difference [P(A−a)DO2] between the normal rats and rats with pulmonary fibrosis. The P(A−a)DO2 was calculated using the formula P(A−a)DO2 = (Pa − PH2O) × FiO2% − PaCO2/R − PaO2 (22), where Pa is atmospheric pressure (the standard state is 760 mm Hg), PH2O is saturated water vapor pressure (the standard state is 47 mm Hg) FiO2% is the fraction of inspired O2 (0.21 for inhalation of air); R is the respiration quotient (R = 1 was used in this study), PaO2 is the arterial pressure of oxygen, PAO2 is the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen, and PaCO2 is the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Dosing and sampling procedures.Rats with pulmonary fibrosis and the healthy control rats were administered, twice daily, either ciprofloxacin (Zhaoyi Biological Co., Ltd., Shanxi, China) at a dose of 60 mg/kg or amikacin (Qilu Pharmaceuticals, Shandong, China) at a dose of 50 mg/kg. According to the manufacturers' recommendations, the intravenous doses of ciprofloxacin and amikacin for pneumonia are 1,200 mg/day [17.14 mg/(kg · day) in a 70-kg patient] and 15 mg/(kg · day), respectively. Because the body weights of the rats with pulmonary fibrosis ranged from 270 to 300 g after 1 month of maintenance, the corresponding surface area-dosage conversion factor from humans to rats used in this study was 7 as recommended (23), and the equivalent human doses for ciprofloxacin and amikacin in rats would be 120 mg/(kg · day) and 105 mg/(kg · day), respectively. Therefore, the aforementioned doses were chosen for this study. Antimicrobials were administered in rats with or without pulmonary fibrosis for 3 consecutive days via tail vein injection. At 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, or 24 h after the last injection on the third day, rats were sacrificed for collecting blood samples and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Separate groups of ≥5 rats were studied for each time point. In brief, after the rats were anesthetized, two blood samples from each rat were obtained using aseptic puncture of the abdominal aorta. The first blood sample was immediately sent for arterial blood gas analysis (ABL 90 flex; Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark), and the second blood sample was centrifuged (2,000 rpm at 0°C for 10 min). The tracheas were immediately cannulated. The lungs were lavaged three times with 2 ml sterile saline of each time, and each lavage lasted for 20 s. The BALF was immediately centrifuged (1,000 rpm at 0°C for 10 min). Both the plasma and BALF were frozen at −80°C until assay. Ciprofloxacin and amikacin assays.Total ciprofloxacin concentrations in serum and BALF were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) according to a previously described method (10). The lower limit of quantification was 0.05 mg/liter. Coefficients of determination (r2) over the standard curve concentrations of 1 to 10 mg/liter for plasma and of 0.05 to 2 mg/liter for BALF were >0.99. Intra- and interday coefficients of variation for the HPLC measurement were 0.49 to 4.46% and 7.72 to 8.83%, respectively, for plasma samples, and 2.21 to 5.0% and 6.84 to 9.51%, respectively, for BALF samples. The recovery of ciprofloxacin in plasma was 100 to 101.2%, and that in BALF was 95 to 99.6%. Total amikacin concentrations in serum and BALF were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry based on the method described by Dijkstra et al. (24). The quantification limit for amikacin was 0.1 mg/liter. Good linearity was obtained, with a correlation coefficient of >0.99 for both plasma in the concentration range of 0.1 mg/liter to 10 mg/liter and BALF in the concentration range of 0.1 mg/liter to 10 mg/liter. Intra- and interday coefficients of variation for the measurement were 3.6 to 8.9% and 5.3 to 9.28%, respectively, for plasma samples and 3.6 to 7.8% and 4.5 to 7.5%, respectively, for BALF samples. The recovery of amikacin in plasma was 86.9 to 120.38%, and that in BALF was 93.0 to 128.5%. Concentrations of antimicrobials in ELF.As urea can diffuse readily through the body (25), we used it as an endogenous marker to determine the actual concentrations of antimicrobials in ELF. Urea concentrations in serum and BALF samples were tested using an enzymatic assay (urea colorimetric assay kit no. K375-100; BioVision, Milpitas, CA, USA) in a microplate reader (Diagnostics, Montpellier, France) according to the manufacturers' specifications. In brief, standard curve was first prepared, and the standard curves were linear (r2 = 0.99) over a concentration range of 0 to 5 mmol/liter. Then, 25-μl BALF samples or 10-fold-diluted plasma samples, 25 μl assay buffer, and 50 μl reagents were added to a 96-well plate. The 96-well plate was protected from light and incubated for 60 min at 37°C. The levels of antimicrobials in ELF were calculated using the following formula: antimicrobial (ELF) = antimicrobial (BALF) × [urea (plasma)/urea (BALF)]. Statistical analysis.Total antimicrobial concentrations in plasma and ELF were plotted against time. The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were calculated based on the mean drug concentration at each time point by noncompartmental analysis using the WinNonlin software program (version 6.2; Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA). The area under the curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0–24) was computed by the linear-up-log-down approach. The antimicrobial penetration into the ELF was evaluated by the ELF/serum concentration ratio at each time point and the ratio of the AUC0–24 in ELF to the AUC0–24 in plasma. Statistical analysis was performed using a statistical software package (SPSS 20.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). When data were normally distributed, an independent t test was used for individual data, a paired-sample t test was used for paired data, and analysis of variance was used to compare the concentrations of urea in plasma and ELF in the four groups. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare data that were not normally distributed. A significance level of 0.05 was applied to all tests.

            "1775 1795 1815 1835 CREDIT_CARD 10331 10350 presumption: Social mood is buffeted by economic, political and cultural trends and events. News of such events affects the social mood, which in turn affects people’s penchant for investing. (2) The socionomic hypothesis: Social mood is a natural product of human interaction and is patterned according to the Wave Principle. Its trends and extent determine the character of social action, including the economic, political and cultural. The contrast between these two positions comes down to this: The standard presumption is that in the social setting, events govern mood; the socionomic hypothesis recognizes that mood governs events. In both cases, the stock market is seen as an efficient mechanism. In the first instance, it presumably revalues stocks continually and rationally in reaction to events; in the second, it revalues stocks continually and impulsively as the independent social mood changes. We will now investigate five presumed “outside forces” to see which of these views their relationship to the stock market supports. The Economy The standard presumption is that the state of the economy is a key determinant of the stock market’s trends. All day long on financial television and year after year in financial print media, investors debate the state of the economy for clues to the future course of the stock market. If this presumed causal relationship actually existed, then there would be some evidence that the economy leads the stock market. On the contrary, for decades, the Commerce Department of the federal government has identified the stock market as a leading indicator of the economy, which is indeed the case. If the standard presumption were true, then changes in the economy would coincide with or precede trend changes in aggregate stock prices. However, a study of Figure 1 will show that changes in the economy coincide with or follow trend changes in aggregate stock prices. Except for the timing of the recession of 1946 (which supports neither case), all economic contractions came upon or after a downturn in aggregate stock prices, and all economic recoveries came upon or after an upturn in aggregate stock prices.1 In not one case did a contraction or recovery precede a change in aggregate stock prices, which would repeatedly be the case if investors in fact reacted to economic trends and events. This chronology persists back into the nineteenth century as far as the data goes. The socionomic hypothesis explains the data. Changes in the stock market immediately reflect the changes in endogenous social mood. As social mood becomes increasingly positive, productive activity increases; as social mood becomes increasingly negative, productive activity decreases. These results show up in lagging economic statistics as expansions and recessions. The standard presumption has no explanation for the relative timing of these two phenomena. 1986-1991 a (A) (C) Inflation-Adjusted DJIA. it will be good/bad for the market. the stock market’s trend was up.3 The socionomic conclusion is this: When social mood waxes positive.

There was an issue with the microphone of the device and I took it to the Nokia Care center at Link Africa, Accra. They informed me that they cannot repair my device under warranty as it wasn't purchased from them and I had to pay 100GHC to get the mobile repaired. It was utterly surprising that a Nokia Center refused to repair a Nokia mobile under warranty. As we all know, any product from a company as big as Nokia is covered worldwide and every device produced by them is their responsibility. I do not think there is any need for me to elaborate further to convey my disappointment with Nokia.

Implementation of protected areas forcentral corridor of Atlantic Forestin Bahia: challenges and limits. Rev. Árvore [online]. 2012, vol.36, n.4, pp.611-623. ISSN 0100-6762. http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S0100-67622012000400004. In Brazil, Protected Areas (PAs) are considered the cornerstone for development of national strategies for biodiversity conservation. Considering this point of view we analyzed thirty protected areas belonging to Atlantic Central Corridor of Atlantic Forest in Bahia, aiming to identify and analyze its current level of implementation. Lemos de Sá and Ferreira (2000) methodology which consist of applying a standard scale, where the variation of the level of implementation conforms to a range of 0 to 5 points was used, with appropriate adaptations. After obtaining the data from the implementation level we use the aggregation method of Ward to help visualize the dissimilarity between the protected areas studied. We used an international classification proposed by IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) for that the UCs to be compared with works done in another countries, the UCs considered are in the groups Ia, II, V and VI da IUCN. As results, 50% of protected areas analyzed are reasonably implemented, 40% inadequately implemented, 6.7% are presented only on paper and only 3.3% can be classified as satisfactorily implemented. These areas presents problems in their regularization; deficiency in infrastructure, human and financial resources. Given the results its clear the recurrent fact that conservation areas under study must be effectively implemented and for this to occur environmental policies should be focused on actions to consolidate the goals of conservation strategy.

Video footage of factory farms can be a valuable tool for animal advocates but often ag-gag laws criminalize such videos.

Presented by Pamela Frasch, assistant dean, Animal Law Program Lewis & Clark; and Joyce Tischler, founder and general counsel, Animal Legal Defense Fund.

Of the three branches of government, the Judicial Branch is the least understood by Oregonians. Unfortunately, a lot of Oregonians get a quick education if they are arrested for a crime or are involved in a civil suit. So often, you peel open your ballot and look at the various races. You come across a couple of candidates running for the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court and your reaction is \"Who are these people?\" I know I have and I usually end up not voting for either. This time, I decided to do a little research on these two candidates to help me decide.Let me give you my opinion on this race. Of course, you decide which candidate receives your vote. Blumnenaur. I know the history of Blumnenauer since I lived in Portland for 24 years while he was on the Portland City Council and US Congressman. I feel strongly about Blumenauer. I would not vote for my own mother if she was endorsed by Blumenauer. Volpert is supported by the Oregon Education Association(OEA), the State Teachers Union and received $1500 from them. Judge candidates are not permitted to advertise their legal philosophy or how they will rule on any particular case. Thus, it is hard to figure out who to support. However, In my mind, do we need to put another judge on the Court Appeals supported by the Liberal Portland Crowd? I think not and I am voting for James C.Egan. 21st century best practices recommended by the ICMA (International City/County Management Association. ICMA www.icma.org.

I am voting for the Home Rule Charter “Voice of the Voters” measure 6-143 Section 9.4 stops this. to decide elections. Who are these voters? What are their beliefs, affiliations and loyalties? The Libertarian Vote: Swing Voters, Tea Parties, and the Fiscally Conservative, Socially Liberal Center reveals that 10 to 20 percent of Americans are fiscally conservative and socially liberal—libertarian. And over the past decade, unlike loyal Democrats and Republicans, they have been swing voters. They have contributed, for example, to the success of both the tea party and the gay marriage movement. The Libertarian Vote provides some of the most pertinent and authoritative insights available on this substantial block of voters. As the book demonstrates, the strength of libertarian voters, and their increasingly decisive role at the center of a divided electorate, remain underestimated and only superficially understood by many candidates and journalists. Candidates and political strategists willing to look more carefully at them may very well discover a large group of voters energetically looking for a home. Rob, here are a few links. This should keep you busy a short time. am voting for because of the strategic political expediency of the decision. On the local ballot in Bandon, the citizens will be making choices for Mayor, three city councilors, a new taxing district, and the members of the board for that new district. surrounding area. Mr. Claassen is an enemy of the taxpayer and he should retire from local politics when his term is up on the city council. his sense of practicality. It would also be good to have a fresh perspective. However, I will be voting “NO” on Measure 6-146. This measure is the proposed formation of the Bandon Community Swimming Pool Recreation District. A pool is a luxury and now is not the time to raise local taxes. let us stop creating more debt and vote against the Bandon Pool District. Vote NONE OF THE ABOVE or NOTA for ALL the candidates running for the position of board member of the new Bandon Community Swimming Pool Recreation District. Commissioner Robert “Bob” Main will be receiving my vote and has my endorsement for County Commissioner Position #1. His opponent, Commissioner Fred Messerle, voted in favor of increasing the maximum indebtedness of the Bandon Urban Renewal Area #1 at a cost to the county of about $30,000 annually until the year 2033. In addition, Messerle has been in favor of the Administrator position from the beginning. Given the opportunity, he would have enacted the administrator ordinance without going to a public vote. He is also deeply involved with the Winter Lake Project and too closely related to the South Coast Development Council. John Sweet will be receiving my vote for County Commissioner Position #2. Tribe as their attorney makes her a liability for the county. Any of her decisions on the O&C lands, as a sitting commissioner, would be a conflict of interest going beyond just perception. Her support of the County Administrator position is a risk to our representative form of government. Dan Pierce will receive my vote and has my endorsement for Director in Zone #2. Charlie Waterman will receive my vote and has my endorsement for Director in Zone #3. I will write-in my own name for Director in Zone #4, because there is no candidate filed in that position and I want another choice. Please feel free to write-in my name. Write-in your own name or write-in someone with integrity for any position that has no candidate running in the race. It is the American way to make up our own choices. Wayne Krieger will receive my vote for State Rep in the Congressional District #1. James L Buchal will receive my vote for Attorney General. Tom Cox will receive my vote and has my endorsement for State Treasurer. He once ran for Governor as a Libertarian candidate and is currently running as a registered Republican. His experience and knowledge of the financial markets will help him in the position of treasurer. Knute Buehler will receive my vote for Secretary of State. It is time for a change. Libertarian candidate, Chuck Huntting, will receive my vote for representative in the 4th District of the US Congress. My choice for president should not reflect the image of the disgruntled voter. In fact, this is a very happy vote for me. I have the great opportunity to vote for my former Governor, Gary Johnson, Libertarian candidate for President of the United States. I will vote for Governor Gary Johnson for President. I was on the committee to elect Johnson for President in 1999 and consider myself ahead of the times. Former Governor Johnson is the right person for the job of Commander-In-Chief. He has experience as Chief Executive in business and politics and was incredible successful in both positions. Obama is a big government socialist with plans to continue to change and reform the fundamental structure of our government. Romney has the same record of increasing the size of government and his foreign policy is identical to the current president. I cannot bring myself to vote for neither the Republican nor the Democrat. Both parties have devalued what it means to be an American, figuratively and literally. It is not a wasted vote to vote for someone of principle and it will force the Republicans to work towards the goal of a limited government or face the consequences of defeat. people and the representatives on the Board of Commissioners. The charter will restrain the growth of authority and allows the voter to retain a representative form of government. I will Vote “NO” on measure 6-144. This is The Ordinance to change the Board of Commissioners and create a County Administrator position or County Czar. Creating a new position will further bloat our local county government and only benefit government developers, to the detriment of the taxpayer. It will increase administrative costs to the county, while eroding representation. I will Vote “NO” on measure 77. This Ballot measure is a constitutional revision relating to state governmental responses to catastrophic disasters. The law is vague and it broadens the scope and power of the Governor. I will Vote “YES” on Measure 78. This measure changes constitutional language describing governmental system of separation of powers and it corrects grammatical and spelling changes. It would be good to have a grammatically correct constitution. I will Vote “YES” on Measure 79. This measure will amend the state constitution and prohibits real estate transfer taxes, fees, other assessments, except those operative on December 31, 2009. This is a double tax on property that discourages businesses from moving to Oregon. I will Vote “YES” on Measure 80. This measure allows personal marijuana, hemp cultivation/use without license and creates a commission to regulate commercial marijuana cultivation/sale. This is a badly written law, but it moves the mark forward towards legalizing marijuana for adults. The cannabis sativa plant is legal for all consenting adults would have been the proper way to write this law. Legislation that simple would be immensely more conducive to our constitutional values than our current situation where there is a War on Drugs. I will Vote “NO” on Measure 81. This measure prohibits commercial non-tribal fishing with gillnets in Oregon “inland waters,” and allows the use of seine nets. This law will destroy more jobs in our state. It does nothing to stop others from performing the same practice of gillnet fishing. I will Vote “NO” on Measure 82. This measure amends the Oregon constitution to permit the establishment of privately owned casinos and mandates a percentage of revenues payable to a dedicated state fund. Sounds good, but it does not allow the construction of private casinos within a 60-mile radius of existing tribal casinos operating on reservation land, which would eliminate 95% of the state. A market that restricted is not free market competition. Moreover, this measure is directed toward one particular casino, which will unfortunately be constructed using government development funding---i.e. ---our tax dollars. I will Vote “NO” on Measure 83. This measure authorizes a privately owned casino, The Wood Village. It would mandate Wood Village to pay a percentage of their revenue to a dedicated state fund. The state is desperately looking for new revenue streams, so they are willing to sell out the competition in the free market just for a few cents on the dollar. A better measure would make the ownership of private casinos in the state of Oregon legal. I will Vote “YES” on Measure 84. This law would phase out existing inheritance taxes on large estates, and all taxes on intra-family property transfers. One of Oregon’s largest exports is its children and young families. our state to put such a burden on families. education K through 12. This is a backdoor tax increase, or otherwise it would be returned to the taxpayer. The school districts already receive the largest piece of the property tax pie. Then these districts turn around and give that money away to private developers through the tax increment financing process of Urban Renewal. What a joke and an insult to taxpayers. We need a revolutionary change for these school boards and we have to stop tax increases. The conversations will be about identifying Libertarian solutions to the problems faced by America and the importance of building the Libertarian Party into a major political party. http://www.facebook.com/events/165112913612960 The event will also be streamed live over the internet visit www.DoubleTheLP.com on Friday for a link to the broadcast. Double The LP is a national Libertarian campaign designed to attract new dues paying members to the Libertarian party by utilizing social media, word of mouth marketing, email marketing and 1-on-1 interaction between current members. The Libertarian Party is the 3rd largest and fastest growing political party in the United States. Polls show that the sentiment across the country is a desire for a real change in politics and that more Americans demand a third party option than ever before.

In 1994, he inherited a state government on the wrong end of every statistic. Within two terms, he had eliminated New Mexico's budget deficit and cut the rate of state government growth in half while reducing the state workforce by over 10% (without laying off a single qualified state worker). While in office, Gary Johnson vetoed 750 bills of wasteful legislation and had thousands of line item vetoes – earning him the nickname, “Governor Veto.” Gary Johnson didn’t just talk about efficient, limited government, he ran one. An avid skier, adventurer, and bicyclist, he has reached the highest peak on four of the seven continents, including Mt. Everest. For more information, please visit www.GaryJohnson2012.com.

Its clear and basic guidelines are for everyone alike. the people, by the people, and for the people.\" That's why the Charter is called \"Voice of the Voters\".

            "1049909106295283 CREDIT_CARD 2926 2942 This Critical Synthesis Package contains: (1) a Critical Analysis of the psychometric properties and the application to health science education of the Index for Interdisciplinary Collaboration (IIC), and (2) a copy of the IIC developed by Laura R. Bronstein, LCSWR, ACSW, PhD. The IIC was designed to measure the perception of collaboration between social workers and other professionals working on an interdisciplinary team. The scale contains 42 items and five subscales: Interdependence, Newly Created Professional Activities, Flexibility, Collective Ownership of Goals, and Reflection on Process. The response options are presented along a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly agree, 5 = strongly disagree) for each item. Mean subscale scores and a total scale score can be calculated. Lower scores indicate higher levels of collaboration. Twelve items are reverse scored. An adapted version of the scale, the Modified Index for Interdisciplinary Collaboration (MIIC), was subsequently developed to survey a broader group of health care professionals working on hospice teams and has similar psychometric properties as the IIC. As a result of the rewording of the IIC to create the more broadly applicable MIIC, the MIIC is better for assessing interprofessional teamwork between individuals within the healthcare field, across multiple settings. Unfortunately, the IIC is limited to use with social workers and lacks sufficient theoretical and psychometric development. Although a factor analysis provided strong support for the IIC as a measure of the perception of interdisciplinary collaboration, the high degree of internal consistency suggests the measure may be best thought of as a global measure of perceptions of interdisciplinary collaboration among social workers, rather than one possessing subscales for separate dimensions. Further work is needed to confirm correlations between interdisciplinary collaboration and the factors thought to influence it. To provide the IIC and supplemental materials to aid in its administration. Bronstein LR. Index of Interdisciplinary Collaboration.

You can create any type of test account you need: Standard, Express, or Custom. You can also create multiple test accounts, e.g., representing multiple countries. You should not connect the platform account to itself, as that fails to reflect the real world use of Connect, and makes debugging quite hard. To test the OAuth flow for connecting another account, create a new Stripe account using another email address and then take that new account through the OAuth flow. This works for both Standard and Express accounts. To test Express accounts without providing a real phone number, use 000 000 0000 as the phone number and 000-000 as the SMS code when prompted. You can create Custom test accounts using the code on the Custom Accounts page. The account does not need to be activated because it can’t be used for live charges. You’ll be able to find your development client_id in your platform settings. To test Top-ups in the Dashboard, enable test mode and select the desired test bank account in the drop-down menu within the top-up dialog. You can simulate a successful top-up or a top-up that fails due to insufficient funds. To test Top-ups in the API, use the following test bank tokens as the top-up source while in test mode. Each token simulates a specific kind of event. When using an access_token derived via the OAuth flow, you can only generate test access tokens using a development client_id, but may generate either live or test access tokens using a production client_id. Note that it’s still preferable to authenticate using the Stripe-Account header, not an access token. As verification is a crucial component for platforms with Express and Custom accounts, we’ve created a dedicated guide to testing verification. Complete file upload instructions are available on the Identity Verification page. Use these magic card numbers on a charge to trigger various conditions when testing tiered verification. 4000000000004202 tok_visa_triggerVerification Triggers a verification stage. 4000000000004210 tok_visa_triggerChargeBlock Triggers a charge block. 4000000000004236 tok_visa_triggerTransferBlock Triggers a payout block. Use this magic DOB to trigger a certain verification condition. 19000101 This DOB will trigger an Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) alert.

You can do this by transferring an amount of your choice to account number BE14 7331 9999 9983 from Kom op tegen kanker (Stand up against Cancer) with the mention \"170207538”. FOTO is the dynamic cycling team of the CRG fertility center at UZ Brussel. Our team wants to support women who have cancer and who want to freeze oocytes and/or ovarian tissue. This gives them a chance to try and fulfill their wish to have a child later on. FOTO is also the name of the research group (Freezing Ovarian Tissue and Oocytes) at the University Hospital Brussels (VUB), the University Hospital St Luc (UCL) and the University Hospital Erasmus (ULB). Together we carry out research and treatments to make this type of treatment as efficient as possible. Women who develop cancer are at risk of becoming less fertile due to cancer treatment (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy) due to an effect on the oocyte supply. In women specifically, we can freeze oocytes or ovarian tissue for later use. That is the treatment we are working on every day, both in our research and in clinical practice.

With your help, we can support promising and pioneering research to develop new and better treatments against cancer faster. We do this by stimulating talented researchers, by joining forces through promotion of collaboration across expertise domains and institutions, and by sharing knowledge and new discoveries with other researchers and society. Each contribution is very welcome and will be deployed by a multidisciplinary committee of expert cancer researchers in the fight against cancer. You can donate to CRIG by transfer on bank account of \"Fondsenwerving UGent\" - IBAN: BE26 3900 9658 0329 (BIC: BBRUBEBB) with reference “CRIG”. When donating 40 EUR or more, you are entitled to receive a certificate for tax reduction. For example, when you donate 100 EUR, you recuperate 45 EUR from your donation via your personal income tax. Supporting cancer research at Ghent University and leave more to your successor at the same time? It is possible. That is because Ghent University pays less inhertitance tax, which normally can go up to 65%. The government thus receives less. This technique (in Dutch called \"duo-legaat\") is perfectly legal and you can count on absolute discretion of Ghent University advisors. Are you celebrating your birthday, a jubilee, a birth or retirement? A successful cancer treatment? You believe that you have already received so much in your life that a gift is not really necessary, but friends and family still want to give something? You could ask them to donate to CRIG. For the generous contributor it will be fulfilling as well to give you such a present and support cancer research. Also for less pleasant occasions such as a funeral it can be a beautiful tribute to support a piece of pioneering cancer research. Do you wish to support in this way? Please contact Ghent University \"cel Fondsenwerving\". You will be gladly and quickly helped with the practical details. Do you organize an event for the benefit of cancer research? A concert or a fundraising dinner, a running or bicycle tour? An evening for your network relations? These initiatives are indispensable. Ghent University \"cel Fondsenwerving\" is glad to listen to your ideas. Or they can inspire you with options which you did not even consider. Or maybe you know people. In turn, they know lots of people. And in this way, you might help us to meet that one person with a heart for cancer research.\n",

This Saturday 16 June will see the third edition of this brilliant family music event taking place, in a new location – the Eras de la Sal open-air arena – due to the fact that the previous location outside the old Monroe’s Bar will not be able to cope with the number of expected visitors this year. It’s amazing to think that only after two editions, this event that raises money for the AECC charity to fight cancer has achieved such an admirable status. No fewer than eight bands are set to perform in this Saturday’s concert, which has the backing of the Department for Charities from the Torrevieja town hall. And with names such as Sense Yuma, Kolted and The Cages on the line-up, there’s no doubt that this will be a quality event. Yet, Rock Against Cancer is for all the family, and activities will start at midday with things like yoga, dance sessions, workshops, inflatables and various games. The music will begin at 17.00h, and on Saturday, punk rock band Sensa Yuma, who have just finished their European tour, will perform for the very last time before retiring. For those who want to find out more about the AECC charity, there will be an information stand installed in the Eras de la Sal, where volunteers will be selling T-shirts, wristbands, bandanas amongst other items, as well as providing information about themselves and what they do. The last edition of Rock in Cancer raised a total of 5,300 euro for the AECC, a thousand euro more than the previous year.

            "FR76 3000 3008 1300 0511 2892 577 IBAN_CODE 1371 1404 An Internet TV channel of (pro-)Russian extremists has published a video featuring four Frenchmen who came to Donetsk in Eastern Ukraine to fight against Ukrainian forces. They do not say their names and think that France will not know of their participation in the terrorist activities in Ukraine. Now it's time to reveal some of their secrets. This video and other evidence I have gathered suggest that Guillaume \"Lenormand\" Cuvelier, Nikola Perovic and Mickael Takahashi first came to Moscow in the second half of June where they met Russian citizen Mikhail Polynkov.* The latter is engaged in assisting international extremists to get to Eastern Ukraine. From Moscow, Cuvelier, Perovic and Takahashi went to Rostov-on-Don. There they were trained for two weeks and then sent to the Ukrainian city of Donetsk which is currently under the terrorist control. Either in Rostov-on-Don or already in Donetsk, they met another Frenchman: Victor-Alfonso Lenta. Guillaume \"Lenormand\" Cuvelier (b. 9 April 1988) is coming from Normandy where he has been participating in various ultranationalist movements for ten years: Jeunesses identitaires (Young Identitarians), Parti de la France (Party of France, PDF), and Troisième voie (Third Way). In 2010, he was PDF's candidate in the Eure department. \"Lenormand\" is his pseudonym. His bank account is with Société Générale (IBAN: FR76 3000 3008 1300 0511 2892 577, SWIFT: SOGEFRPP) through which the whole group of the French right-wing extremists is funded. Victor-Alfonso Lenta (b. 1989?) is coming from Toulouse. He is a former corporal of the 3rd Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment, and served in Afghanistan, Chad, Ivory Coast and Gabon. He is said to have been kicked out from the army for his involvement in a neo-Nazi group. On his return to Toulouse, he actively participated in the Jeunesses identitaires. Nikola Perovic (b. 1989?) has dual French/Serbian citizenship and apparently lives in Belgrade. He is a former corporal of the 13th Battalion of the Chasseurs Alpins and served in Afghanistan. Michael Takahashi (b. 13 October 1987) is coming from Paris. He is an ardent supporter of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and has been cooperating with various ultranationalist groups in France and Serbia. So, what are these Frenchmen doing in Eastern Ukraine? All four are extreme right activists who are influenced, especially Cuvelier and Lenta, by the ideas of the European New Right. The four Frenchmen have founded a group called \"Unité Continentale\" (Continental Unity), and its manifesto provides further insights into the ideology they share. They believe that the French government is \"a puppet of Brussels\" and that NATO is \"a terrorist military alliance that uses French army to serve the interests of banks\". The EU, in their view, denies France's national sovereignty, while France itself is \"a slave of the American Empire that dictates the country's foreign policy and directly interferes in the domestic policy\". The solution of the alleged problem, according to the Unité Continentale, is Neo-Eurasianism, an ideology elaborated by Russian fascist Aleksandr Dugin, which they call \"Continentalism\". It rejects globalisation and liberalism, as well as advocating the destruction of the EU. Instead, they promote \"cooperation between the major nation-states of Europe and their respective areas of influence\". Russia would play an important role in this cooperation and, especially, in their fight against \"Anglo-Saxon globalism, Atlanticism and the decadent West\". The Unité Continentale's ideologues do not see the conflict in Eastern Ukraine as Russia's long-planned war on Ukraine. Rather, they think that the US and the EU have attacked Eastern Ukraine. Therefore, by killing Ukrainians, the Unité Continentale is waging a war on the US and EU. In an interview to one Russian website, Cuvelier says that he believes that the West has started the Third World War in Lybia and Syria and it has now spread to Ukraine. Russia, in its turn, has challenged \"the international globalism\", and the Unité Continentale is happy to assist Russian forces and its proxies in Eastern Ukraine in murdering Ukrainian people. They call it \"Eurasian solidarity\". * - The previous version of this post erroneously claimed that Hungarian right-wing extremist Ferenc Almássy had also visited Moscow and met with the fighters and Mikhail Polynkov. However, there has been no further evidence that Almássy was indeed in Moscow. At the same time, he seems to have interviewed Cuvelier and Takahashi in Budapest in 2015 for TV Liberté. We remember french collaboration with nazists. France even provide mistral to terrorussia when she kills ukrainian people!!! Actually, they seem to be dragging their feet on turn the Mistral over. The French Underground was one of the things that knocked the Nazis down hard. Lots of extremely brave Frenchmen took on suicide missions to get rid of the Nazi plague. Thank you for the info!

Abstract: Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a cardiomyopathy associated with sporadic or familial disease, the latter having an autosomal dominant mode of transmission. Echocardiography is the current gold standard for diagnosis of this entity, but with the risk of over diagnosis and under diagnosis. There are frequent doubtful cases, that need multimodality confirmation (echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging). The clinical features associated with LVNC vary from asymptomatic to symptomatic patients, with the potential for heart failure, supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, thrombo­embolic events, and sudden cardiac death. There is no therapy specific for patients with LVNC. The treatment focuses on the complications of the disease. Rezumat: Noncompactarea de ventricul stâng este o cardio­mio­patie sporadică sau familială, cea din urmă având o trans­mitere autozomal dominantă. Ecocardiografia este stan­dardul de aur actual în diagnosticarea acestei afecţiuni, cu toate că acestă metodă implică un risc de supradiagnostica­re sau subdiagnosticare. Există frecvent cazuri incerte, în care o abordare multimodală este necesară, corelând rezultatele ecocardiografice cu cele obţinute prin rezonanţă magnetică. Tabloul clinic variază de la pacienţi asimptomatici la pacienţi cu insuficienţă cardiacă, aritmii supraventriculare sau ventriculare, evenimente tromboembolice şi moarte subită cardiacă. Nu există tratament specific al noncompactării de ventricul stâng. Tratamentul are ca scop prevenirea şi tratarea complicaţiilor bolii. Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a cardio­myopathy with genetic determinism, that it is not widely accepted like a distinct cardiomyopathy, still being considered a congenital or aquired morphological characteristic of other different cardiomyopathies1. In the position statement of the European Society of Cardiology, LVNC is included in the unclassified cardiomyopathies group because it is not clear whether it is a separate cardiomyopathy or merely a morphological trait shared by many phenotypically distinct cardiomyopathies2. The American Heart Association classified LVNC as a primary cardiomyopathy. The characteristic echocardiographic features in individuals affected by LVNC include a thick, bilayered (compacted and noncompacted) myocardium; proeminent ventricular trabeculations; and deep intertrabecular recesses. The population prevalence of isolated LVNC is not known, but it is reported in 0.014% -1,3 % of consecutive echocardiograms. In large paediatric series, LVNC is reported to be the commonest cause of unclassified cardiomyopathies3. In some reports, LVNC is more frequent in men than in women (1,5:1)4. This poor estimation of the LVNC prevalence is partially explained by the non uniform diagnostic criterias used. The prevalence of LVNC has raised because of a better echocardiographic identification. The various names used to describe the morphologic profile of LVNC include ‘‘honeycomb,’’ ‘‘persistent sinusoids,’’ ‘‘spongy myocardium,’’ ‘‘persistent embryonic myo­cardium’’, ‘‘hypertrabeculation,’’ ‘‘LVNC,’’ ‘‘LVNC/hyper­trabeculation syndrome,’’ and ‘‘noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium5. Briefly, in the development of the heart, the myocardium has a trabeculated aspect with deep intertrabecular recesses. This stage is encountered before the development of coronary arteries. In the 5 to 8 week of gestation the compaction of the myocardium has place, the intertrabecular recesses becoming the coronary arteries. The process of trabecular compaction in humans starts at the base and progresses toward the apex. Compaction is most pronounced in the left ventricle, and substantial growth and compaction occur throughout postnatal development. LVNC is hypothesized to be due to early cessation of compaction of trabecular meshwork during embryogenesis. The result is an epicardial layer that is compacted and an endocardial layer with prominent trabeculae and deep intertrabecular recesses that communicate with the left ventricle cavity. Because the apex is the last to undergo compaction, ventricular noncompaction is usually localized toward the apical region. There have been described familial and acquired form of LVNC. The discussion against the developmental hy­pothesis comes from serial echocardiographic studies where LVNC was not diagnosed on initial echocar­diogram but was becoming evident in subsequent examinations. Recent advances in genetics, however, raise the question whether LVNC can also develop postnatally. Some genes have been linked to the development of LVNC: tafazine, β-distrobrevine (DTNA), Cyber/ZASP (LDB3), laminine A/C (LMNA), SCN5A, MYH7 and MYBPC31,3. Some genes involved in LVNC are also involved in hypertrophic cardiomyopaty and dilated cardiomyopathy (genes that encodes sarcomeric proteins)6. There are report of some association between LVNC and congenital cardiac defects. For example, Barth syn­drome is a X-linked disorder (G4.5 gene in Xq 28 region) characterised by LVNC, dilated cardiomyopathy, neutropenia and skeletal myopathy1,6. Histologically, LVNC is defined by deep intertrabecular recesses which communicate with the left ventricular cavity. Fibrosis has been described in multiple reports with endomyocardial thickening and subendocardial fibroelastosis. Several reports have observed necrotic myocytes within the prominent trabeculaes, but not in the epicardial layer. Those trabeculaes are often localized near the apex and papillary muscles are not totally developed7. The two layers of myocardium and the trabeculaes are vascularized by the coronary arteries, and the intertrabecular recesses are getting blood from the ventricular cavity. In the development of the heart, there arise a mismatch between the myocardial mass and the number of capillaries. In conclusion, there is a hypo perfu­sion of the endocardial myocardium despite normal epi­cardial coronary arteries. This amount of ischemia is responsible for the progressive fibrosis that ultimately will depress the systolic function of left ventricle and pre­dispose to ventricular arrhythmias. The excessive trabeculation will compromise the diastolic function of left ventricle, also8. We should permanently consider LVNC a potentially thromboembolic disease, because the blood stagnate in the intertrabecular recesses predisposing to clots formation, that can embolise in the systemic circulation8. The asymptomatic period is very different, but it is estimated that the mean time from the beginning of symptoms to the diagnosis is about three years10. The triad of heart failure symptoms, arrhythmias and embolic events is the major clinical manifestation in patients with reduced systolic left ventricular func­tion and is comparable in adult and paediatric populations. Various patterns of arrhythmias, ranging from atrial fibrillation (7-26%) to sustained ventricular tachycardia (41%), can be observed. There have been reported cases presenting with atrioventricular block, left bundle branch block and sudden cardiac death11. Incidental and familial discovery of LVNC has been associated with high probability of a stable course over several years, whereas patients with symptoms of HF, histories of sustained ventricular tachycardia, or enlarged left atrium have an unstable clinical course and a grave prognosis18. The symptoms can vary widely: atypical chest pain, syncope, systemic and pulmonary embolism. It is important that mortality and morbidity is proportional to the severity of systolic dysfunction of left ventricle. – WPW pattern in young patients. Electrocardiography can be normal in 13% of patients12. A ratio of 1,29 between compacted and non compacted myocardium is considered normal. There are some nor­mal variants, like: hypertrabeculated left ventricle and septomarginal trabecula. The most used and vali­dated method of diagnostic is echocardiography. Se­veral echocardiographic and magnetic resonance imaging definitions for the diagnosis of LVNC have been proposed and used in published studies. There are thee sets of echocardiographic criteria (Chin, Jenni and Stollberger) and two sets of magnetic resonance imaging criteria (Peterson and Jacquier) (Table 1). Table 1. Echocardiographic and magnetic resonance imaging diagnostic criterias for LVNC (modified by 3). Although all of the proposed definitions attempt to describe the morphology of LVNC, there is variability in these definitions. The lack of a true ‘‘gold standard,’’ such as a reliable genetic marker, makes it difficult to know whose criteria are ‘‘best’’ and ought to be used preferentially. Echocardiography. Chin et al. defined LVNC as a ratio of compacted/compacted + noncompacted myocardium <0.5 at end-diastole (using parasternal short-axis for the apex and apical views for the left ventricle free wall)10. Jenni el all defined LVNC as ratio of noncompacted/ compacted myocardium > 2 measured at end systole (using apical short-axis view)13. Stollberger defined LVNC as trabeculations (≥ four trabeculae) protruding from the left ventricle wall, lo­ca­ted apically to the papillary muscles and visible in one imaging plane14. Each sets of echocardiographic criterias used have advantages and disadvantages15. Jenni et al. criterias, using end-systolic thickness, were validated against autopsy as well as other structural heart disease. Also with autopsy confirmation, Chin et al. criterias, using end-diastolic measurement, allow for optimal measurement of noncompacted and compacted myocardium in some cases. There are observation that the measurements of the thickness of each layer of the bilayered myocardium are made more precisely during end-diastole, like in Chin’s criterias, than during end-systole, like in Jenni’s criterias. Some observational studies have reported that the thickness of noncompacted myocardium do not change during cardiac cycle unlike compacted myocardium that increases its thickness during systole because its contractile reserve5. According to this data, Jenni’s criteria has higher specificity and lower sensitivity than Chin’s criterias27. There was poor correlation among the three echocardiographic definitions, with only 30% of patients fulfilling all three criteria15. Those criterias tends to over­diagnose LVNC, because 8% of healthy individuals fu­l­filled one criteria15. Echocardiography tends to overestimate de prevalence of LVNC in black individuals. Speckletracking echocardiography (STE) gives promising result in borderline cases, because LVNC affects the left ventricle twist16. Echocardiographic pitfalls. A good echocardiographic exam depend on the experience of the investigator and it is important to have a very good echocardiographic window. The oblique section (frequently the short axis view) generates a lot of inconclusive or false positive results. There are some normal variants that prone to confusion: hypertrabeculated myocardium, septomarginal trabecula, papillary muscles. Frequently, it is very hard to visualize the left ventricle apex and a lot of cases of LVNC localized at the apex are missed3. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Peter­son et al. and Jacquier et all’s have elaborated some magnetic resonance imaging criterias for defining LVNC (Table 1). CMR has been successfully used to distinguish myocardial trabeculations from global LV mass. A trabeculated LV mass > 20% of the global LV mass is regarded as a sensitive and specific finding for the diagnosis of LVNC17. CMR approaches are evolving and may hold promise for more accurate identification of LVNC. Others investigations. Positron emission tomography (PET), which quantitatively evaluates myocardial blood flow and coronary flow reserve, may be used to assess microcirculatory dysfunction ultimately responsible for the wall motion abnormalities. Cardiac catheterization is used when there is a cardiac congenital defect in association with LVNC. The typical features of IVNC have also been observed by ventriculography. After injection of contrast me­dium, the ‘‘loosened’’ myocardium can be identified. However, a left ventricular angiogram and corona­ry angiography are usually performed to rule out other concomitant cardiac abnormalities and not for the diag­nosis of LVNC. Differential diagnosis between dilated cardiomyopathy and LVNC can be a challenge in dilated ventricles. There have been identified some risk factors in patients with LVNC, like: age at initial presentation, NYHA class, sustained ventricular arrhythmias, the extent of non compaction, left ventricle end diastolic diameter (Table 2). Despite limitations of the published risk factors for adverse outcomes, they are helpful to guide treatment, including medical therapy and device therapy20,21. In a larger series of patients, long-term follow up (39 months) showed that 35% died, half of them because of sudden cardiac death, and 12% (four patients) had undergone heart transplantation. The high incidence of both thromboembolic events (24%) and ventricular tachycardia (41%) in that series underscores the poor clinical prognosis for patients with impaired left ventricular function19. Table 2. Prognostic factors in LVNC (modified by 3). There is no therapy specific for patients with LVNC. Treatment for noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium focuses on the 3 major clinical manifestations: heart failure, arrhythmias, and systemic embolic events. Patients with LVNC that develop systolic or diastolic heart failure should be managed according to the guidelines in use22,23. The beneficial effects of the β-blocker carvedilol on left ventricular function, mass, and neurohormonal dysfunction in an infant with LVNC have been described24. When heart failure is progressive, despite maximum medical therapy, device therapy should be considered. Cardiac transplantation has been used for those with refractory congestive heart failure. Patients with LVNC should be closely evaluated for ventricular arrhythmias. Because of the frequency of ventricular tachycardia and significant risk of sudden cardiac death and systemic embolism, assessment for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias by ambulatory ECG monitoring should be performed annually. Patients with LVNC and sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation require implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implant. Radiofrequency ablation also may be a consideration. Prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implant in the absence of documented hemodynamically significant ventricular tachycardia is currently not recommended25. Prevention of embolic complications is an important management goal and remains a matter of debate in these patients. The incidence of thromboembolic complications ranges from 5% to 38%26. Because deep intertrabecular recesses with sluggish blood flow aggravate the risk of thrombus formation, it is recommended oral anticoagulation (target INR 2.0–3.0) in patients with impaired systolic function (LV ejection fraction ≤40%), previous history of trombembolism, transient ischemic attack, being aware of the absence of any robust data to support this approach3. Anticoagulation therapy, however, must be targeted to the individual patient after careful assessment of the benefit and risks. There have been used some metabolic cocktails, with somewhat good result in children: B1 and B12 vitamin, Q10 coenzyme and carnitine. This results are explained by the high frequency of the mitochondrial abnormalities in patients with LVNC. There are no guidelines for exercise prescriptions or restrictions for LVNC in the literature. Even in the most recent review of this subject by Oechslin and Jenni in 2011, no mention is made of the advisability of exercise restriction or prescription. This is a large gap in clinical practice that needs attention through further systematic evaluation of these patients to understand the risk exercise poses to this subset of patients3. It is reasonable to reevaluate the patients biannually. The patients must be put on a waiting list for heart trans­plantation, especially symptomatic patients. We should not forget the screening of relatives. Knowledge and understanding about aetiology, embryogenesis of the myocardium, genetic background, diagnosis and outcome of LVNC have steadily improved. Non-compaction of the left ventricular myocardium is within a diverse spectrum of myocardial morphologies/ cardiomyopathies triggered by gene defects/mutations: the causal role of LVNC in the pathogenesis of a distinct cardiomyopathy is questionable. LVNC results from an arrest of normal ventricular myocardial maturation by heretofore unknown molecular mechanisms. The resulting bilayered ventricular myocardium is prone to LV diastolic and systolic dysfunction, HF, arrhythmias, and thromboembolic complications. Echocardiography is the current gold standard for diagnosis of this entity. Echocardiographers and clinicians have to be cautioned not to overdiagnose LVNC. Newer imaging approaches and technologies may continue to redefine diagnostic criteria for this unusual and distinct cardiomyopathy. There is no therapy specific for patients with LVNC. The treatment focuses on the complications of the disease. Conflict of interests: The authors declare that no conflict of interest exists. 2.

The retreat takes place in the hospitable ‘Bosoord’ at Loenen(www.bosoord.nl). The main language will be English. The programme involves formal meditation, meditation instructions, talks and discussions. In addition, there will be working meditation for about an hour each day. During this weeklong retreat, we will explore and cultivate the practice of awareness that leads to well-being and liberation. When the mind is supported by skilful qualities and is unclouded by confusion, greed, and negativity, reality can be accurately recognized. We are able to see that everything that appears is the natural display of impersonal conditions giving rise to their lawful effect. With the ease of simply knowing our own experience moment by moment, deeply conditioned habits of mind that lead to suffering for ourselves and others are weakened. Natural wisdom and compassion can arise and grow. This retreat will be held in Noble Silence and is suitable for beginners as well as more experienced meditators. People from all walks of life are warmly welcome. The costs of the retreat are € 514 for a double room. There are only a few single rooms (costs € 605). Please contact the organizer of the retreat before applying for a single room. If the costs present a possible obstacle for application, please consult the Chairman of the SIM, Hans Gijsen: +31 (0)6 20233245. You register by paying the costs on Triodos bank account IBAN NL72 TRIO 0338 4690 87, BIC TRIONL2U mentioning ‘Stichting Inzichts Meditatie - Ezinge’ and: Pascal Auclair Retreat 2018. Don’t forget to mention your full name. Also fill the General register form SIM-retreats (click here or you can find it on the www.simsara.nl site in Agenda in the right column). You are kindly requested not to forget to mention your meditation experience, in English. Your registration is confirmed upon payment of the registration fee. Applications will be accepted following the order of arrival of payments. Most Vipassana meditation retreats are organised on the basis of Dana (Generosity). Since the time of the Buddha, the transmission of his teachings and the meditation instructions are considered a deed of generosity. The costs of the retreat consist of basic lodging fees and meals; the teachers receive only reimbursement for travel and accommodation expenses. At the end of the retreat, the participants have the opportunity to practice generosity; they are invited to give Dana (donation) to the teacher. After application, you will receive more details approximately two weeks prior to the retreat. For more information about the retreat you can contact Marcel Herwegh: or +31 (0)6 28247412.

Ent., we have already cooperated with Tim Bučar last year in the final conference of the project Fair Employment – Youth with Less Opportunites with the Help of Youth Work to First Job. In a two-day-long event, Tim fried pancakes right out of his three-wheeled bike. Tim actively collects paper, scrap metal and empty car batteries, which help him collect resources for his therapies. He needs 2.400 Euros a year. Thus we have decided to help him collect paper between 5th and 15th April 2019, we will be collecting waste paper, commericals, newspapers, magazines etc. at the Roma Station, at Preradovičeva 1 in Maribor. The action will take place every workday between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.. In Slovenia there are only 9 people with a rare genetic disease, Apert Syndrome. The most notable symptome of the given syndrome is the change in the development of the skull an facial bones. Tim has had 15 major surgeries. His life depended on the operation of the skull, where bones have grown together, as his brain otherwise couldn’t have fully developed. Another such operation was the one where they have implanted a drainage tube which drains extra liquor from his brain to the stomach area. Tim enjoys making pancakes at various events. He also likes to prepare smoothies, mow the lawn and other stuff. How can you help Tim? Tim is accepting donations on the transaction account ZAVOD ODPRTE KARTE, KEKČEVA 22, 1000 LJUBLJANA.

            "20170824 US_BANK_NUMBER 1986 1994 Bug 1435644: Also regenerate the signed apps. FAIL | security/manager/ssl/tests/mochitest/browser/browser_certViewer.js | should have successful verification message - \"Could not verify this certificate because it has expired.\" == \"This certificate has been verified for the following uses:\" I suspect the certificate just expired and that it needs to be renewed. David, looks like you're familiar with this test, could you take a look? Thanks! Maybe we could stay open with just the browser-chrome failure, but xpcshell has something over 30 tests failing, and the chance of a sheriff noticing either that there was a newly-added 35th failure after them, or that someone landed a security patch and caused a new failure in the middle of that spew of failure is approximately zero. Closed mozilla-inbound, mozilla-central, autoland, mozilla-beta, mozilla-release, and mozilla-esr52 for this, so when you have a fix please coordinate landing it directly on mozilla-central with a sheriff so they can merge it around and we can reopen trunk trees as quickly as possible. Looks like these certificates (and therefore start/end dates) were generated at build time until bug 1256495. I didn't check all certs but lgtm. Land it if you checked that these are all certs that need renewing. Missed a few which didn't call GeneratedTestKey, thanks for making me double-check ;). I think carrying over Franziskus' review is ok for this. > Looks like some certs got updated which should not have been, e.g. /me does not know what he's supposed to do with those. Looks like some of them are just testing certs in a specific date, so some of the certs should be reverted I guess. Aryx and I are going through those and trying to figure them out. Attachment #8948347 - Attachment description: Bug 1435644: Regenerate the security/manager/ssl test certificates and keys. → Bug 1435644: Also regenerate the signed apps. The issuer of the failing test cert, \"int-nsSGC-recent.pem\"  is only valid through 20170824, so regenerating the end entity  with no specified validity is by default creating an end entity issued after the intermediate has expired, which will cause a failure. we should add probably the same line to the end entity, to ensure it's both valid on 25 August 2016 as well as issued during the validity of the intermediate. Apologies for not catching this earlier, and thanks to all for getting this sorted out so far. This patch fixes the test_cert_eku.js failures for me locally. Actually, no, this isn't quite right. Hopefully this is correct now. This looks right. Thanks for taking care of this! Thanks so much for finishing this up! David, looks like this'll need rebased patches for mozilla-release (Fx58). Can you please attach those? Getting this grafted to m-r was pretty straightforward when done on top of bug 1413336. However, that bug is not grafting cleanly to ESR52 and I think it's going to be more risky trying to get it to do so vs. coming up with an ESR52-specific version of these patches. David, can you please take a look? Sure (also, just fyi - my irc client isn't able to connect to irc.m.o at the moment, but I'm on slack). 39 failures in 79 pushes (0.494 failures/push) were associated with this bug yesterday. Can you please take a look, Franziskus? This looks like the certs in dom/security/test/contentverifier weren't updated. It appears https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/e393e6c239cd#l20.12 (bug 1340181) is preventing that entire test directory from running, which is why it isn't failing on mozilla-central (or anything after 54). Since these certificates don't have certspec files and since I believe the end-entity has to have a special key, I don't know how to regenerate them. Franziskus? Ah, right, the code was mostly removed so the tests aren't really necessary anymore. Ok - thanks. I had to update the root hash preference value in the tests as well, since the root changed. We are indeed fixed across all affected branches now. Thanks for the patches! 39 failures in 702 pushes (0.056 failures/push) were associated with this bug in the last 7 days. This is the #31 most frequent failure this week.\n",

            "9780814719541 US_BANK_NUMBER 14953 14966 Not to be confused with New York City Department of Transportation. The New York City Board of Transportation or the Board of Transportation of the City of New York (NYCBOT or BOT) was a city transit commission and operator in New York City, consisting of three members appointed by the mayor. It was created in 1924 to control city-owned and operated public transportation service within the New York City Transit System. The agency oversaw the construction and operation of the municipal Independent Subway System (IND), which was constructed shortly after the Board was chartered. The BOT later presided over the major transfers of public transit from private control to municipal control that took place in the 1940s, including the unification of the New York City Subway in 1940. In 1953, the Board was dissolved and replaced by the state-operated New York City Transit Authority, now part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). In 1874, the New York State Legislature passed a bill allowing for the creation of a rapid transit commission in New York City, which was formed in 1875. This commission mapped out elevated railway routes that would be built by private companies, but did not plan any underground lines. In 1889, Mayor Hugh J. Grant created a five-member rapid transit board to lay out lines in the city. In 1891, the State Legislature passed the Rapid Transit Act, allowing the government of New York City and all cities with a population of over one million to create a board of \"rapid transit railroad commissioners\", which would dictate the expansion of rapid transit facilities within the city. The government could issue bonds in order to fund rapid transit for the city. That year, a five-member rapid transit board was created for the city, called the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners. The board received bids for a municipal underground rail line, but no bids were selected. The board was abolished in 1894 by the State Legislature due to its failure to create a subway line. It was replaced by a new board whose members included the Mayor of New York City. That year, the New York City government issued a referendum stating that future rapid transit lines should be municipally operated, as opposed to issuing franchises to private operators. In spite of this, the initial subway lines to be operated in the city − the \"first subway\" opened in 1904, and the initial portion of the Centre Street Loop to Essex Street opened in 1908 − were privately operated by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) respectively. The initial 1890s transit board was replaced in 1907 by the state-run New York Public Service Commission (PSC). This agency would oversee the Dual Contracts subway expansion, which led to the construction of new lines for the IRT and BRT. Until 1924, municipal public transportation actions originated primarily from state-controlled agencies, including the 1891 and 1894 rapid transit boards, the PSC, and most recently the New York State Transit Commission which was created in March 1921. Following the creating of the State Transit Commission and the reelection of Al Smith as Governor of New York in 1922, then-mayor John Francis Hylan and future mayors Jimmy Walker (then a state senator) and John P. O'Brien (the city's corporation counsel) sought to establish a city-controlled transit commission. Hylan had been both an opponent of private transit operation, particularly that of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT; the successor to the BRT), and a political opponent of Smith. Hylan also had his own plans for a city-operated subway system. In 1924, the New York City Board of Transportation was created by the New York City Board of Estimate following a bill passed by New York State Legislature. The Board of Transportation would responsible for mapping and constructing new rapid transit lines, carrying out the powers dictated in the 1891 Rapid Transit Act, while the State Transit Commission would continue to oversee the privately operated systems. The bill had been deadlocked in the State Assembly for two years until a compromise bill was introduced in February 1924 and passed on April 11 of that year. Governor Smith signed the bill into law on May 2, and the BOT assumed power on June 1. The board's first chairman was John Hanlon Delaney, one of Hylan's top advisers who had been the transit construction commissioner since 1919. The BOT would release the initial plans for what would become the Independent Subway System (IND) on December 9, 1924, based largely off of Mayor Hylan's plans. The first IND subway line and the system's trunk line, the IND Eighth Avenue Line, broke ground on March 14, 1925, and was opened on September 10, 1932. On August 29, 1929, the BOT released its first major plans for the expansion of the city-owned system still under construction. A revision of this proposal was released almost ten years later on July 5, 1939. These plans would later be called the IND Second System, and would go largely unbuilt due to the Great Depression and World War II. Beginning on June 1, 1940 under the mayoral administration of Fiorello H. La Guardia, the Board of Transportation took over the assets of the IRT and BMT for municipal operations in an event referred to as unification. The event placed the three rapid transit systems − IRT, BMT, IND − under a single operator. The BOT also inherited the BMT's extensive surface transit network in Brooklyn and Queens, which consisted primarily of streetcar lines along with a few electric trolley coach and diesel-powered bus routes. The BOT proceeded to close the IRT-operated Second and Ninth Avenue elevated lines in Manhattan, and the BMT-operated Third and Fifth Avenue elevateds in Brooklyn. On December 15, 1940, the IND's second Manhattan trunk line − the IND Sixth Avenue Line − was completed. In 1941, the BOT began motorizing the former BMT streetcar lines in Brooklyn and Queens into diesel bus routes or trolley coach routes. The further motorization of surface lines, and the completion of the IND system, however, was delayed due to World War II. Unification made the Board of Transportation the largest public transit operator in North America, in addition to being one of the few systems under public ownership at the time. Following the end of World War II, the BOT resumed subway construction. On February 23, 1947, the Board of Transportation assumed the bus routes of Isle Transportation in Staten Island. On March 30, 1947, the BOT took over the North Shore Bus Company in Queens. Both companies could not operate on the mandated five-cent fare and went bankrupt. This gave the city control of the majority of surface transit in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. It also created three distinct surface transit divisions: the Brooklyn Bus and Trolley Division, the Staten Island Bus Division, and the Queens Bus Division. On September 24, 1948, the BOT took over the East Side Omnibus Corporation and Comprehensive Omnibus Corporation in Manhattan. At this time, the BOT resumed motorizing trolley lines, and proceeded to construct new storage and repair facilities. It also purchased new buses, to either replace streetcars or the dilapidated buses inherited from private operators. A GM \"old-look\" transit bus bearing the original green and white color scheme of the Board of Transportation, and a white circular BOT logo. The color scheme would be inherited by the Transit Authority. Following an artificial operating surplus during World War II, brought on by gas and rubber rations leading to increased mass transit usage, the Board of Transportation had its first operational deficit in 1947, amounting to $18 million. On March 30, 1948, Governor Thomas E. Dewey signed legislation to allow the BOT to increase fares with the approval of the New York City mayor. On July 1, 1948, the Board of Transportation raised the fare for its rapid transit system from five cents to ten cents, with the approval of Mayor William O'Dwyer. The nickel fare had been in place in the subway system since October 27, 1904, a period of 45 years, and was one of the main provisions of the Dual Contracts. New York City was the last major city to have a five-cent fare. The BOT also created 14 new free transfers between the formerly-separate subway divisions. The fare increase was put forward due to increasing debt, inflation in the post-war period, expenditure on new subway routes, equipment and facilities, and maintenance of the existing system which was in disrepair. In addition, city planner Robert Moses pushed for the fare increase to allow more city funding to go towards highway development, while Transport Workers Union of America leader Michael J. Quill supported the fare hike in order to give transit workers a 30-cent per hour wage increase. In 1950, the fare of BOT surface transit was also raised to ten cents. Upon the initial 1948 increases, a twelve-cent fare had been put in place for a combined trip on the subway and either bus or trolley, but this was eliminated on July 1, 1952. The fare hikes did not effectively increase revenue for the Board of Transportation to offset increasing operation costs, while system ridership plateaued due to the American car culture and increasing migration to the suburbs. After two years of financial surplus, the BOT experienced a $1.2 million deficit in 1950, and a $24.8 million deficit in 1952. The BOT was also criticized due to the influence of politics on the organization, the direct control over the board by the mayor, and the use of the city's operating budget to subsidize transit operations. In March 1953, the New York State Legislature created the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), a public authority without direct control from a political office, with members appointed by both the Governor and Mayor. Governor Dewey signed the bill approving the creation of the TA into law on March 20, 1953. On June 15, 1953, operation of the New York City Transit System was turned over to the Transit Authority, with the Board of Estimate leasing the system to the TA for a period of ten years. The Board of Transportation, meanwhile, was dissolved. The new Transit Authority was modeled after the existing Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, the latter of which is also now part of the MTA. An entrance to the Jay Street–MetroTech subway complex adjacent to 370 Jay Street, the former Board of Transportation Headquarters. The Board of Transportation's final headquarters was located at 370 Jay Street, at the northwest corner of Jay Street and Wiloughby Street in the modern MetroTech Center of Downtown Brooklyn. The building is bound by Pearl Street to the west, and was formerly bound by Myrtle Avenue at its north end; this portion of the street has since been de-mapped. The 14-story office building was designed by architects William Haugaard and Andrew J. Thomas in post-war modernist style. The building is L-shaped, the long side along Jay Street, and the short side along the former Myrtle Avenue. The outer facade of the building consists of white limestone, with 420 square and uniformly-arranged casement windows. The building was intended to serve as the central headquarters of the BOT. The building housed 2,500 employees from several divisions of the board including its executive, legal, and engineering staff. The remainder of the building not used by the BOT would be rented out. The ground level of the building at Jay and Wiloughby Streets is designed with numerous columns forming an arcade. Haugaard, the lead designer, had drafted the design prior to World War II. Within the arcade and adjacent to the building are several entrances to the Jay Street–MetroTech subway complex, which consisted of two separate stations when the building was constructed. The location was selected in order to be in close proximity to the lines of all three subway divisions, in order to collect fares via money train. Passageways from the subway stations, including a visible door in the Jay Street IND station, lead to a money sorting room in the basement of the building. Ground broke on the site on October 8, 1948. The building was erected at a time when many other BOT transit facilities were also being built. The headquarters opened on April 1, 1951, just two years before the BOT ceased existence, and after the death of Haugaard. It cost $10 million to construct. The BOT proceeded to vacate its former headquarters, one at Hudson Street at the entrance to the Holland Tunnel in Hudson Square, Manhattan, and the other in the former Paramount Theatre in Downtown Brooklyn. Following the dissolution of the BOT, the building was used by the Transit Authority as its headquarters, and later used by the MTA with some space rented out to other organizations including the New York City Police Department. In 1990, the Transit Authority moved its primary headquarters out of 370 Jay Street, to its current location on Livingston Street. Other MTA operations were moved to 2 Broadway (now the headquarters of MTA Bridges and Tunnels) in Manhattan in 1998. In January 2006, the money train operations ended, after which the MTA largely vacated the site. The building is currently being converted for use as part of the Brooklyn Campus of New York University. ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o Report including analysis of operations of the New York City transit system for five years, ended June 30, 1945.

Health hazard evaluation report: HETA-88-328-1961, United States Army Corps of Engineers, Arlington, Virginia. In response to a request for technical assistance from the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers (SIC-9999), Arlington, Virginia, a study was made of possible hazardous working conditions at Fort Myer, Fort McNair, and Cameron Station, located in the Washington, D.C. area. These three sites each had polychlorinated-biphenyl (1336363) (PCB) containing transformers. Maintenance workers visually inspected these transformers for leakage and manually felt around the gauges and valves for leaking oil. The employees did not repair the leaks, only report then to the supervisor. No detectable PCBs were noted in seven personal breathing zone samples. Area air samples for PCBs ranged in concentration from not detectable to 4.8 micrograms/cubic meter (microg/m3). Surface wipe samples ranged from not detectable to heavy contamination levels. Many of the transformers were leaking material suspected as containing PCBs. The author concludes that although breathing zone samples did not contain detectable concentrations of PCB, there was a potential for exposure to PCB contaminated surfaces. The author recommends that areas having heavy PCB surface contamination be cleaned up, that employees responsible for conducting clean up procedures wear appropriate personal protective clothing, that additional surface samples be taken following clean up to determine the effectiveness of the procedure, and that employees conduct quarterly inspections of the transformer vaults wearing protective gloves during the checking for leaks.\n",

            "26400504 US_BANK_NUMBER 2023 2031 Modern North Pacific intermediate water (NPIW) is formed in the mixed water region where the Oyashio and Kuroshio currents meet. The source for cooling and freshening of NPIW is intermediate water in the Okhotsk Sea. The Okhotsk intermediate water outflows to the open Pacific, forming the Oyashio intermediate water by mixing with the subarctic gyre water. In the Oyashio region, the intermediate water originating from the Okhotsk Sea flows mainly at depths shallower than 500 m. On the other hand, ventilation of intermediate water in the subarctic Pacific during the deglaciation remains a topic of debate. In this study, foraminiferal δ18O and δ13C signatures were determined in a dated sediment core collected at 777 m water depth to evaluate the intensity and depth distribution of the source of NPIW since the last deglaciation in the Oyashio region. Benthic foraminiferal δ18O increased by 0.3–0.4‰ from the end of the Bølling/Ållerød warm episode to the Younger Dryas cold episode, suggesting intermediate water cooling. Consistent with this trend, benthic δ13C values point to decreased nutrient contents during the cold event. Conversely, benthic δ18O signatures from a nearby core site at a water depth of 1,366 m did not show such cooling. These results suggest that cold intermediate water originating from the north was actively ventilated at depths of at least 700–800 m, and possibly even 1,200 m during the Younger Dryas, implying that NPIW ventilation was thicker and deeper than under modern conditions.

            "16135425 US_BANK_NUMBER 345 353 Here is an attempt to write a function which will remove trashy characters (^F, ^S, ^Z, zero-width space, etc) on save, and keep cursor position. The overall idea about function was taken from Martin Tournoij's answer about removing whitespace: https://vi.stackexchange.com/a/456, and regex was taken lincz's answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/16135425. To post it here I replaced tab characters with >--- and control characters (^F, ^S) with ##. If you have cursor on letter a in bar - it will be moved to r. If you have cursor on letter b in baz - it will be moved to z (because there are two control characters before it). DJMcMayhem posted an answer at February the 5th, but it seems it doesn't properly work for tab-indented lines. That's why I started a bounty. I tried to fix it by changing getcurpos() to getcurpos(), but my \"knowledge\" of Vimscript is too low. Like Ralf said, your function is correctly saving the cursor position. The issue is when characters to the left of your cursor get deleted. It keeps track of the old cursor position, and then calculates how many characters before that column will be deleted, and compensates. Edit: switched exec normal | to cursor(), since that function compensates for tabs whereas | does not. Edit 2: Added the /e flag to the substitute command so that it will not throw an error if there are no unprintables to remove. Keeping personal vimrc and syntax files etc in source control? How to jump back to the cursor position before I entered insert mode? How to keep Vim from exiting Visual Mode due to mouse clicks while mouse=a? Keep \\t Characters, While Don't Transform Spaces to Tabs?\n",

            "10093252 US_BANK_NUMBER 7091 7099 New York, NY — November 3, 2016 - Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation (the \"Company\") (NYSE:ACRE), a specialty finance company engaged in originating and investing in commercial real estate assets, reported net income of $18.4 million or $0.65 per diluted common share and adjusted net income from operations of $9.0 million or $0.31 per diluted common share(1) for the third quarter of 2016. In addition, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter 2016 dividend of $0.26 per common share payable on January 17, 2017 to common stockholders of record on December 30, 2016. (1) Refer to Schedule I for further details. • For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net income was $18.4 million or $0.65 per diluted common share. • For the three months ended September 30, 2016, new originations were $605.2 million in commitments and $577.4 million in outstanding principal and an additional $9.0 million of fundings on existing commitments. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, loan repayments totaled $251.8 million in outstanding principal. • In July 2016, the Company amended the master repurchase facility with Citibank N.A. to add an accordion feature that provides for an increase in the $250.0 million commitment amount with respect to approved assets, as determined by Citibank, N.A. in its sole discretion. • In August 2016, the Company amended and restated the existing $50.0 million Bridge Loan Warehousing Credit and Security Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. to increase its commitment size from $50.0 million to $125.0 million. • In August 2016, the Company entered into a $125.0 million master repurchase and securities contract with U.S. Bank National Association. • In September 2016, the Company repaid in full its $75.0 million revolving funding facility with City National Bank and its terms were not extended. • In September 2016, the Company drew the remaining $80.0 million commitment under the Credit and Guaranty Agreement with Highbridge Principal Strategies, LLC, as administrative agent, and DBD Credit Funding LLC, as collateral agent. • On September 30, 2016, the Company completed the previously announced sale of its mortgage banking business to Barings Real Estate Advisers LLC (formerly known as Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers LLC) for approximately $93 million. • The purchase price is subject to certain post-closing final working capital adjustments. The Company recognized a net gain on the sale of ACRE Capital Holdings LLC (\"TRS Holdings\"), a Delaware limited liability company and the holding company that owned the Company’s mortgage banking subsidiary, ACRE Capital LLC (\"ACRE Capital\"), of approximately $10.2 million. At September 30, 2016, the Company had originated or co-originated 34 loans held for investment (excluding 42 loans totaling approximately $1.2 billion in outstanding principal that were repaid or sold since inception) totaling approximately $1.6 billion in commitments and $1.4 billion in outstanding principal, excluding non-controlling interests held by third parties. (2) Unleveraged Effective Yield is the compounded effective rate of return that would be earned over the life of the investment based on the contractual interest rate (adjusted for any deferred loan fees, costs, premium or discount) and assumes no dispositions, early prepayments or defaults. The Total Weighted Average Unleveraged Effective Yield is calculated based on the average of Unleveraged Effective Yield of all loans held by the Company as of September 30, 2016 as weighted by the Outstanding Principal balance of each loan. As of September 30, 2016, 93% of the portfolio of loans held for investment consisted of floating rate loans and 88% consisted of senior mortgage loans (as measured by outstanding principal), excluding non-controlling interests held by third parties. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, ACRE Capital originated $280.7 million in total commitments comprised of $215.5 million in Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing loans, $20.0 million in Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation loans and $45.2 million in Federal Housing Administration loans. As of November 2, 2016, the Company had approximately $132 million in capital, either in cash or in approved but undrawn capacity under its borrowing facilities. After holding in reserve $10 million in liquidity requirements, the Company expects to have approximately $122 million in capital available to fund new loans, fund outstanding commitments on existing loans, repurchase the Company's common shares and for other working capital and general corporate purposes. Assuming that the Company uses all such amount as capital to make new senior loans and the Company is able to leverage such amount under its secured funding agreements at a debt‑to‑equity ratio of 2.5:1, the Company would have the capacity to fund approximately $425 million of additional senior loans. As of November 2, 2016, the total unfunded commitments for the Company's existing loans held for investment were approximately $92 million. In addition, borrowings under the Company's secured funding agreements were approximately $852 million, borrowings under the Company's secured term loan was approximately $155 million and debt issued in the form of collateralized loan obligations was approximately $21 million. On November 3, 2016, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter 2016 dividend is payable on January 17, 2017 to common stockholders of record as of December 30, 2016. On August 4, 2016, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per common share for the third quarter of 2016. The third quarter 2016 dividend was paid on October 17, 2016 to common stockholders of record as of September 30, 2016.

Core Earnings is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding non-cash equity compensation expense, the incentive fee, depreciation and amortization (to the extent that any of the Company’s target investments are structured as debt and the Company forecloses on any properties underlying such debt), any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income (loss) for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income (loss), and one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash charges after discussions between the Company's external manager and the Company’s independent directors and after approval by a majority of the Company’s independent directors. (1) Includes both ACRE and ACRE Capital stock-based compensation.

            "9998086875 US_BANK_NUMBER 563 573 It works. There is a trick to modifying the divisor which of course is the same thing as banking debt. Just had one of the worst sessions on record: 1:124 1:105 1:174 all in a row. To give you an idea of how bad my bet selection was doing, the worst performing number on the wheel was outperforming me! I would have done better betting the worst number and just staying there! Yet, it was one of the most relaxing sessions as the Ahlcon Divisor kept the bets very low while maintaining proper relationship with the debt. My numbers simply came in at chances of 0.9998086875 certainty. Only 27.67% of my bankroll came into play. We have to believe in the impossible, the silly and impractical because statistics are a very mind bending thing. All I can say is we must believe what Talos says because he is not lying. i came upon the 1/60 rule that is used to correct flight direction should they stray off from their original path. I wonder if this can help us in our roulette progression or does it has something to do with DrTalos' unique progression? As I said, I forgot about selection, I kept aside outcome. Statistically speaking, I should hit one number every 37 played (38 on American Wheel). Let's consider variance, because statistic works on big numbers, and I tried if I could sustain 1 hit every 40 numbers played, then 45, then 50... I stretched the idea till the maximum I could manage, and I find myself in the ratio 1/60, that is quite good, in my opinion. I don't think that means we cannot use a different number but that the minimum number that is necessary is 1:60. Nice video. I can finally say that I have read the whole thread now. The number 60 just represents the largest number that Talos could affordably use to stay in touch with the debt. The Talos game is all about how quickly our numbers come in at a rate of 1:60. what i find interesting about this entire thread is that no one thinks its a coincidence that ryeth posted about the system years before drtalos reiterates it in a cryptographic form? Annnd ryeth is still gone? i mean he said he was going to meet talos or something before he left... am i wrong? we cant be sure that's the system Talos is playing. One canon of his is that he never plays even chance which that system is playing. drtalos reiterates it in a cryptographic form? Rather than just explain his system he eeks every possible second to be vague and i feel that even though he might have a system, the salesmanship turned me off to even reading into anything the guy says. when people talk in circles, as well as saying alot about something that is probably easy to learn and do yourself. No, he definitely has something that is out of the ordinary. I have reached the stage where he describes the winning system but I must accept the rare losing session where he is doing something that allows him to play for the win. Reyth is our only hope and proof that his system is real. But too bad he disappeared from the forum about the same time as talos. Talos did something with Reyth. If you read and analyze well the session and numbers played/balance like i did in the beginning of this post it’s impossible that the system work like he explained or you will reinvent the maths. So taking that into account i’m very sceptical now that the whole story is true. And i definitely forgot about the idea that a never losing system exist. Except with an infinite bankroll. Why not taking the session and continue the analysis ? It’s the only very valuable piece he left and we see that it’s mathematically impossible so i will maybe continue to believe like i did at some moments that all these ideas and canon where to make us work to give him some solution about a system he really wanted. Well there is nothing wrong with a winning system, by definition, its profitable. Because he tracks variance so well, its very easy to know when we are at the point he mentions \"close to a win but a session that is not ending\" and we simply choose the best time to end it. If we set up the statistics properly, it should be easy to make up the loss very quickly and the rest is just profit. Just had a 1:451 won game event with the chances of winning at 99.6%, my drawdown was just at 1/3 of my bankroll. We started the session with 0:161 which is a 98.81% event but then failed to close the session and went 0:143 which is a 98.11 event! There was a slight hiccup following that which brought our total loss events to 4 in the session and we then successfully closed it out. What the Talos method does is track negative variance with the idea that by keeping our ability to always finish the game at 1:60 but betting as little as we can while still doing that, we will eventually outlast that negative variance. His betting method allows for multiple coups to recover the debt by establishing a range between the highest loss and the current debt. The logic can run that the amount one bets while still within that range, is irrelevant and only closing the game at 1:60 matters. Like I have said though, he has achieved this level of success and discovered something even more profound because eventually I arrive at the point where my enterprise becomes absurd and I must negotiate some kind of loss, surrendering the 1:60 ratio for the safety of my bankroll and my future profits over time.\n",

Beginning at birth, infants apply a significant amount of effort to actively participate in and shape their world. Infants make their intentions and requests for support known through their behaviors during social and physical therapy encounters. The therapeutic encounter viewed from the infant’s perspective has received limited attention in the physical therapy literature.

After launching, the PSP gets stuck on a black screen and then it turns itself off after a few seconds. - Retroarch 1.6.9 , 1.6.8 and 1.6.7. The 1.6.0 version throws PSP error 80010002. The only version that it seems to be working is 1.3.6 (which is outdated). I know a bit of PSP developing, but nothing that of a big deal.. I'm unable to solve this on my own. Since it's open source, is there any developer out here kind enough to look into it? Bosshunter, v1.3.6 has some saving issues. Use v1.3.3. It's still the same cores. Last edited by Oldvic on Sat Nov 25, 2017 3:21 am, edited 1 time in total. Sorry Butcher, I mean't to address Bosshunter. I put your name by mistake (I've now edited my post). But yeah, Retroarch is pretty buggy on the PSP. I only use it for PC Engine, which is actually quite good on it. Yea, I figured that 1.5.0 is the last working retroarch build. So I will use that version until (if) someone gets the latest build to work. Or probably its best to stick to standalone emulators.\n",

These comparative benchmarks allow the reader to quickly gauge a country vis-à-vis others. Using econometric models which project fundamental economic dynamics within each country and across countries, latent demand estimates are created. This report does not discuss the specific players in the market serving the latent demand, nor specific details at the product level. The study also does not consider short-term cyclicalities that might affect realized sales. The study, therefore, is strategic in nature, taking an aggregate and long-run view, irrespective of the players or products involved.

It also shows how the P.I.E. is divided across the world’s regional and national markets. For each country, I also show my estimates of how the P.I.E. grows over time (positive or negative growth). In order to make these estimates, a multi-stage methodology was employed that is often taught in courses on international strategic planning at graduate schools of business. In order to estimate the latent demand for automotive adhesives on a worldwide basis, I used a multi-stage approach. Before applying the approach, one needs a basic theory from which such estimates are created. While the debate surrounding beliefs about how income and consumption are related and interesting, in this study a very particular school of thought is adopted. In particular, we are considering the latent demand for automotive adhesives across some 190 countries. The smallest have fewer than 10,000 inhabitants. I assume that all of these counties fall along a \"long-run\" aggregate consumption function. This long-run function applies despite some of these countries having wealth; current income dominates the latent demand for automotive adhesives. So, latent demand in the long-run has a zero intercept. However, I allow firms to have different propensities to consume (including being on consumption functions with differing slopes, which can account for differences in industrial organization, and end-user preferences). Given this overriding philosophy, I will now describe the methodology used to create the latent demand estimates for automotive adhesives. Since ICON Group has asked me to apply this methodology to a large number of categories, the rather academic discussion below is general and can be applied to a wide variety of categories, not just automotive adhesives. Latent demand is therefore estimated using data collected for relatively efficient markets from independent data sources (e.g. Euromonitor, Mintel, Thomson Financial Services, the U.S. Industrial Outlook, the World Resources Institute, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, various agencies from the United Nations, industry trade associations, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank). Depending on original data sources used, the definition of automotive adhesives is established. In the case of this report, the data were reported at the aggregate level, with no further breakdown or definition. In other words, any potential products that might be incorporated within automotive adhesives fall under this category. Public sources rarely report data at the disaggregated level in order to protect private information from individual firms that might dominate a specific product-market. These sources will therefore aggregate across components of a category and report only the aggregate to the public. While private data are certainly available, this report only relies on public data at the aggregate level without reliance on the summation of various category components. In other words, this report does not aggregate a number of components to arrive at the \"whole\". Rather, it starts with the \"whole\", and estimates the whole for all countries and the world at large (without needing to know the specific parts that went into the whole in the first place). Given this caveat, in this report we define the sales of automotive adhesives as including all commonly understood products falling within this broad category, such as polyurethane, epoxy, acrylic, silicone, shape memory polymer (SMP), and polyamide resins, adhesives used for body in white, paint shops, powertrains, and assembly, and adhesives used in passengers vehicles, buses, trucks, and light commercial vehicles (LCV), irrespective of product packaging, formulation, size, or form. Companies participating in this industry include Henkel and Co., H.B. Fuller, Bostik, Sika, 3M, and Illinois Tool Works Corporation. In addition to the sources indicated below, additional information available to the public via news and/or press releases published by players in the industry was considered in defining and calibrating this category. All figures are in a common currency (U.S. dollars, millions) and are not adjusted for inflation (i.e., they are current values). Exchange rates used to convert to U.S. dollars are averages for the year in question. Future exchange rates are assumed to be constant in the future at the current level (the average of the year of this publication’s release in 2019). Based on the aggregate view of automotive adhesives as defined above, data were then collected for as many similar countries as possible for that same definition, at the same level of the value chain. This generates a convenience sample of countries from which comparable figures are available. The interested reader can find longer discussions of this type of modeling in Studies in Global Econometrics (Advanced Studies in Theoretical and Applied Econometrics V. 30), by Henri Theil, et al., Kluwer Academic Publishers; ISBN: 0792336607; (June 1996), and in Principles of Econometrics, by Henri Theil John Wiley & Sons; ISBN: 0471858455; (December 1971), and in Econometric Models and Economic Forecasts by Robert S. Pindyck, Daniel L. Rubinfeld McGraw Hill Text; ISBN: 0070500983; 3rd edition (December 1991). Simply stated, the effect of income on latent demand is assumed to be constant across countries unless there is empirical evidence to suggest that this effect varies (i.e., the slope of the income effect is not necessarily the same for all countries). This assumption applies across countries along the aggregate consumption function, but also over time (i.e., not all countries are perceived to have the same income growth prospects over time and this effect can vary from country to country as well). Another way of looking at this is to say that latent demand for automotive adhesives is more likely to be similar across countries that have similar characteristics in terms of economic development (i.e., African countries will have similar latent demand structures controlling for the income variation across the pool of African countries). This approach is useful across countries for which some notion of non-linearity exists in the aggregate cross-country consumption function. For some categories, however, the reader must realize that the numbers will reflect a country’s contribution to global latent demand and may never be realized in the form of local sales. For certain country-category combinations this will result in what at first glance will be odd results. For example, the latent demand for the category \"space vehicles\" will exist for Togo even though they have no space program. The assumption is that if the economies in these countries did not exist, the world aggregate for these categories would be lower. The share attributed to these countries is based on a proportion of their income (however small) being used to consume the category in question (i.e., perhaps via resellers). For these countries, equilibrium latent demand is assumed to be perfectly parametric and not a function of wealth (i.e., a country’s stock of income), but a function of current income (a country’s flow of income). In the long run, if a country has no current income, the latent demand for automotive adhesives is assumed to approach zero. The assumption is that wealth stocks fall rapidly to zero if flow income falls to zero (i.e., countries which earn low levels of income will not use their savings, in the long run, to demand automotive adhesives). In a graphical sense, for low-income countries, latent demand approaches zero in a parametric linear fashion with a zero-zero intercept. In this stage of the estimation procedure, low-income countries are assumed to have a latent demand proportional to their income, based on the country closest to it on the aggregate consumption function.\n",

            "9779883347 US_BANK_NUMBER 4175 4185 Every Brand has both Positive and Negative elements. Same can be said about Human Body. Two major functions of Kidneys in human body are to filtrate (retaining elements good for the body and rejecting those which are harmful), and excretion of bad elements. When Kidneys don’t work properly, harmful elements increase in the body in the form of toxins, which damage many vital organs of the body. In medical terminology, it’s called Renal or Kidney Failure. When a similar thing happens to a Brand, it’s called Renal failure of Brand. How do Kidneys work for a Brand? Every Brand has some key elements attached to it. When these key elements come under attack, it becomes absolutely necessary to filter and facilitate immediate excretion of the negative elements from the Brand. The chances of Renal Failure of the Brand increase manifolds when this excretion process takes longer and the quantum of the attack is bigger. Remember the Maggi fiasco? What’s the Tag line of Maggi? Taste Bhi, Health Bhi. They probably had used this tagline because Instant Noodles as a product has always remained under suspicion from health angle. In April 2015, a government referral laboratory in Kolkata, following up on an initial report from Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh, reported excess lead in samples of Maggi Noodles. Maggi then commanded 63 per cent share of India’s Rs 5,000 crore noodles market. Maggi noodles are like a way of life for many people, and this information came as a shock for both the Company as well as its loyal consumers as there was a built up of negative perception on a mass scale about health concerns upon Maggi’s consumption. How did Nestle, the parent Company prevent/manage the Renal failure of the Brand? Firstly, they immediately pulled the product from the Market, and destroyed more than 37000 tonnes of the Product. Why was it essential? Since there was a question mark on one of the most essential elements of the Brand, and there was huge media coverage and public outcry, there was an immediate change in demand level (heavy fall in sales from Retailer’s shelf). Since Instant Noodles is a perishable product, this reduced demand could have resulted in a pile of expired or near expiry product in a matter of a month or two, and could have resulted in choking of the whole distribution network (an extremely vital organ in FMCG). That was an instance of saving a vital organ resulting from immediate increased negativity in the Brand (Renal failure). Nestle also changed their India head as the previous one was unable to act in a timely manner. This was equivalent to Kidney Transplant. Suresh Naraynan, the new head was like a fresh set of Kidneys for Nestle, as he was brought in to filter out the negativity and to then bring in new positivity. Maggi was banned by Indian Government in June 2015, but Nestle under Suresh Naraynan insisted on the Safety of its product and contested the ruling. Courts overruled the Ban in August 2015, and Maggi after undergoing all the court mandated tests was re-launched in November, 2015. By June 2016, Maggi Noodles climbed back to 57% share. If an Essential or Key element of a Brand is under major attack, measures should be taken to save all the vital organs of Business, irrespective of the costs involved. Whether you are at a fault or not, a timely step in the backward direction may be the most essential requirement. Always fight for the reputation of essential elements of your Brand. Since you can’t change these elements, fight for their pride. Easier said than done, there are many situations where Key People can’t be changed, or the essential elements of a Brand have been damaged beyond a Point. How to manage that? I’ll discuss such Case Studies in my future Posts/ Books. A person’s own personal brand can also face renal failure. Also, there are many instances of Renal failure in Political Branding. Brand “Shiromani Akali Dal” in Punjab is one such instance. I may discuss the details in my future posts.

            "9789004311299 US_BANK_NUMBER 5255 5268 3 Complications of the \"personal gesture\" On 19 February 1954, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued a decree transferring the Crimean Oblast from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to the Ukrainian SSR. The documents which are now housed at the State Archive of the Russian Federation (GARF) do confirm that the move was originally approved by the Presidium of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) on 25 January 1954, paving the way for the authorizing resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union three weeks later. According to the Soviet Constitution (article 18), the borders of a republic within the Soviet Union could not be re-drawn without the agreement of the republic in question. The transfer was approved by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union; however, according to article 33 of the constitution, the Presidium did not have the authority to do so. The constitutional change (articles 22 and 23) to accommodate the transfer was made several days after the decree issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Consequently, amendments were made to the republican constitutions of Russia and Ukraine. On 2 June 1954 the Supreme Soviet of Russia adopted amendments to the Russian Constitution of 1937, which, among other things, excluded Crimea from list of subdivisions enumerated in article 14, and on 17 June 1954, the Verkhovna Rada added Crimea to article 18 of the 1937 Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR. On 27 June 2015, the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation accepted the request of the leader of A Just Russia party, Sergey Mironov, to evaluate legitimacy of 1954 transfer of Crimea and stated that the transfer violated both the Constitution of the Russian SFSR [Wikidata] and the Constitution of the Soviet Union. The text of the document signed by Russian Deputy Prosecutor General Sabir Kehlerova Mironov stated: \"Neither the Constitution of the RSFSR or the USSR Constitution provide powers of the Presidium Supreme Soviet of the USSR for the consideration of the changes in the constitutional legal status of the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, members of the union republics. In view of the above, the decision adopted in 1954 by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviets of the RSFSR and the Soviet on the transfer of the Crimean region of the RSFSR to the USSR, did not correspond to the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the RSFSR and the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the USSR.\" Complications of the \"personal gesture\" In an interview with Charlie Rose, Henry Kissinger stated it was possible Khruschev gave Crimea to Ukraine because he was drunk at the time. The transfer increased the ethnic Russian population of Ukraine by almost a million people. Prominent Russian politicians such as Alexander Rutskoy considered the transfer to be controversial. Controversies surrounding the legality of the transfer remained a sore point in relations between Ukraine and Russia for the first few years after the breakup of the Soviet Union, and in particular in the internal politics of the Crimea. However, in a 1997 treaty between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, Russia recognized Ukraine's borders, and accepted Ukraine's sovereignty over Crimea. In 1994, a Russian nationalist administration under Yuriy Meshkov took over in Crimea with the promise to return Crimea to Russia, although these plans were later shelved. After the overthrow of President Victor Yanukovych during the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, the territories of Sevastopol and Crimea were seized by the Russian Federation; the annexation was formalized following an unconstitutional referendum in which 96% of the Crimean population purportedly voted \"Yes.\" This move was denounced by the new Ukrainian government and disregarded by most UN states, which continue to recognize Crimea as part of Ukraine. The Venice Commission (an advisory body of the Council of Europe in the field of constitutional law) issued an opinion in 2014, concluding that the referendum was illegal under the Ukrainian constitution and that \"circumstances in Crimea did not allow the holding of a referendum in line with European democratic standards.\" ^ Mark Kramer (March 19, 2014). \"Why Did Russia Give Away Crimea Sixty Years Ago?\". ^ a b \"The Gift of Crimea\". www.macalester.edu.

Indeed, further legislative acts and constitutional amendments were needed to legitimise the territorial changes in that region. On 2 June 1954, the Supreme Council of the Russian SFSR adopted the Law on the introduction of changes and amendments to Article 14 of the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the SFSR, according to which the Crimean Region was excluded from Soviet Russia at the same time that the Supreme Council of the Ukrainian SFSR introduced changes to the Ukrainian Constitution. ^ \"USSR's Nikita Khrushchev gave Russia's Crimea away to Ukraine in only 15 minutes\". pravda.ru.

            "ad:: IP_ADDRESS 24812 24817 Just arrived in Delhi? You have a day? With a little planning you will be able to make the most of it. So, savour the moments and soak in the sights. Start early so you get to experience more of it. As you have just one day, take a cab. Taxis are available in plenty and it’s the quickest way to see around Delhi. Fix the price in advance, or go by the meter. For budget travelers, there are day trips organized by Delhi Tourism. The buses are pretty comfortable, but the only disadvantage is that you cannot go at your own pace. We have given you a tentative itinerary based on how you can maximize your Delhi experience. However, keep a guide book handy. You can refer to it when needed. Delhi is steeped in history. The edifices are a testimony to its multi cultural /historic background. You need to rush through because there’s a lot to see, yet very less time in your hands, and don’t underestimate the peak-hour Delhi traffic. If you are starting from the airport, make sure you have a good breakfast for it will take quite a while before lunch. Head off straight to the QutabMinar in Mehrauli. (Airport to Mehrauli is 9.6 kms. It will take about 20 minutes, from the airport). Don’t miss the Asokan iron pillar right inside the QutabMinar complex. It’s almost 7 m in height and weighs more than 6 tons. You will notice that the free standing iron pillar has not degenerated or rusted in so many years. After pondering over our forefathers’ evolution in science, proceed to the Garden of Five senses. (1.5 kms. This is about 15 mins from QutabMinar) A must see for a truly rejuvenating experience, which will keep you going for the next couple of hours. Following the experience in the Garden, visit the Bahai Temple at East of Kailash, (At 6.4 kms and just over 15 mins from the Garden). Shaped like a lotus, this is one architectural marvel that looks amazing from all sides, (especially the aerial view, if you can spot it from the flight, when you are in it). Take a look around, relax and enjoy the peace and quiet inside the temple. Next on the agenda, after the visit to the temple, is the Red Fort in old Delhi (11.6 kms, which is around 25 mins from the Bahai temple). The Fort is a massive structure in sandstone red. The aesthetics of the Red Fort represent Mughal creativity at its peak. Just bypass the local shopkeepers and don’t get too carried away by their wares. You really have no time to haggle with prices. The memorial is next on the sight seeing list. Close to Red Fort is the memorial of the Father of the Nation - Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat. (It is at a distance of 1.5 kms from the Fort). The memorial is set in the midst of deep green lawns. It is a square platform in black with the last words of the Mahatma inscribed on it. If you would like to linger around for a bit of shopping, Connaught Place has plenty of attractions. Janpath is close by. It’s an arcade full of shops and definitely a shopper’s delight. Near by is the underground shopping centre, Palika Bazar where you could just browse around for a wee bit of shopping. These places are within walkable distance from Connaught Place. You could just stroll around and get back to the spot where your cab is parked. The final visiting spots would be the RashtrapathiBhavan (the official residence of the president of India) and the India Gate (a memorial for the soldiers who fought in the WW1). Connaught Place to RashtrapathiBhavan is about 2.8 kms while RashtrapthiBhavan to India Gate is another 2.9 kms. Reserve the visit to these two places towards the evening or night as the RashtrapathiBhavan presents a splendid view when lit up, while India Gate appears captivating with the eternal flame under the arch - the Amar JawanJyothi, burning steadily. That was quite a hectic trip, but it’s not all over yet. There's plenty more. Put it on your agenda for next time. A good pair of foot wear is essential since there’s lot of walking to be done. Avoid shoes with shoe lace as they may be a hindrance to remove and put on, while visiting places of worship. Eateries are available at every corner; ensure you go to the reputed ones. Experience the enigma of the city of Delhi, which encapsulates the old and the new. Explore the enticing sights of the old which evoke the ancient past and enjoy the thrills of the new. We do not think that the complete New Delhi experience can be had in 3 days, but we have done our best to give you the experience in a capsule. So be ready to devour the city and its surroundings in 3 days. No trip to Delhi is complete without the Taj Mahal at Agra(about 4 hours from Delhi). We have also included the rustic Jaipur in what is often called the ‘Golden Triangle Trip’. So here goes… Delhi, Agra and Jaipur in three days. Take a tour around Delhi and its myriad attractions. Visit the various monuments, forts and memorials. Break for lunch at Chandani Chowk for a taste of the authentic cuisine. Chandani Chowk is famous for its eateries as well. One such is the ParantheWaliGali a famous gourmet locality well-known for its Indian breads or paranthas. Some of the cooks in these eateries are descendants of the emperors in the bygone eras. Continue with the visits and complete the day with a late night entertainment at one of the recommended places. Maybe a Bollywood movie, a concert, or the disco? Pick your choice from the various options available. On the morning of day two, visit the Taj Mahal in Agra. A truly amazing sight and a must see. Agra is about 205 kms from the city and the drive will take about 4 -5 hours. The Taj Mahal as one of the seven wonders is an attraction not to be missed. Its amazing; its breathtaking; it leaves you very sentimental; brings tears into your eyes; we’ll let you fill in the adjectives by yourselves. The next stop after the Taj Mahal is Fatehpur Sikri just outside Agra, which was established by the great Mughal emperor Akbar. This is yet another one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture. Don’t miss the tomb of Salim Chishti in white marble among the rest of the buildings in red sandstone. Jaipur is a favoured tourist destination, with its magnificent mahals and bustling bazaars. The attractions range from architectural splendours like the Hawa Mahal, City Palace, Amer Fort and observatory – Jantar Mantar, (similar to the one in Delhi but on a grander scale), to adventurous rides on elephants and camels and a whole lot more. After Jaipur visit, now get back to Delhi in time for dinner of a sumptuous spread in a wide range of cuisine. Check out the many restaurants that are popular and offer a variety of spreads that is sure to tantalize your taste buds. You have visited and experienced quite a bit of Delhi and its neighboring destinations, but that was just a slice. There is lot more of history and culture left. Perhaps on another trip! 'Hawa Mahal', or Palace of the Wind, is a landmark of Jaipur. Made of red and pink sand stone, the monument with a spectacular view of Jaipur city, was originally conceived with the aim of enabling ladies of the royal household, to watch the world from within the Mahal. The palace encloses a series of courtyards, sprawling gardens, several palatial structures, and museums. Each section of the Palace has its distinct feature. The imposing gateways, scalloped arches, and columns are marvels of Rajput architecture. Jantar Mantar is a collection of architectural astronomical instruments, modelled after the one built in Delhi but on a grander scale. The observatory consists of fourteen major geometric devices for measuring time, predicting eclipses, tracking stars in their orbits, ascertaining the declinations of planets. It is a blend of Hindu and Mughal architecture. The reflection of the Fort in the lake, is a remarkable sight. Amer Fort houses the famous Sheesh Mahal - a beautiful hall of mirrors that are so artistically set, that the tiniest ray of light reflected in the mirrors, illumines the hall. Delhi is a city of culture and history. The only way to feel its soul is to explore it. Provided here are two options to spend 5 days. The first is a tour of the Golden Triangle which is sightseeing Delhi and neighboring Agra and Jaipur. Another option to the 5 day visit, is to spend the first two days in Delhi and the next three at a hill station. Himachal Pradesh close to Delhi is a travellers paradise with spectacular mountain views, lush green valleys, and cascading rivers down the mountain side. You could take time off to experience the magic of the mountains. Indulge in some local sight seeing the first day in Delhi. Begin the day with visits to the historical sites. Start with the imposing Qutab Minar, the famed brick minaret. After Qutub Minar visit Humayun’s Tomb- one of the best-preserved Mughal monuments in Delhi. Follow it with a visit to The Garden of Five Senses which is in the same vicinity. Spend some time there for a truly relaxing experience. After the experience in the Garden, proceed to Chandni Chowk to explore Red Fort - the colossal citadel built in red stone. Break for lunch at one of the eateries close by, for a taste of some authentic cuisine. Post lunch visit Raj Ghat, the memorial of the Mahatma and Jama Masjid - the largest mosque in India. In close proximity to the mosque is Purana Quila, yet another fort. Make sure you are at the Quila by evening, in time for the sound and light show which entails the history of Delhi. Proceed to Connaught Place for a stroll around the place and some shopping if you wish. To complete the sightseeing for the day, round it up with a drive to the Parliament House and the India Gate, both of which are well illuminated at night. Have Dinner at one of the restaurants in Connaught Place and call it a day. Begin day two with an early morning trip to the historic site of Agra for a visit to the Taj Mahal. Follow the Taj Mahal trip with visits to Fatehpur Sikri, the Fort built by Emperor Akbar. Complete the day with a visit to Brindavan and Mathura. These are the places of mythological interest. The place abounds in tales of Lord Krishna and the anecdotes from his life. Stay overnight at Agra or get back to Delhi. Note: Taj Mahal is closed on Friday. Plan your trip accordingly. On your third day plan a trip to Jaipur which is about 4 hours from Agra or 6 hrs from Delhi. Jaipur is an amazing destination with some interesting historical sites and marvels as well as fascinating bazaars. Take a tour of its tourist’s spots like the Hawa Mahal, City Palace, Jantar Mantar. Experience an elephant / camel ride, at the Amer Fort. Stay overnight and get back to Delhi the next day. Back in Delhi; spend the rest of your fourth day seeing some more of Delhi. Visit the temples, Laxmi Narayan Temple / Birla Temple, Bahai/Lotus Temple. Shaped like a lotus, this temple is a must see. Then there is the ISKCON temple and Akshardham temple. You can enjoy programmes in the IMAX theatre or the musical fountain in the Akshardham temple complex. Visit Jantar Mantar the observatory at Connaught Place. Take a look at the Safdarjung Tomb representing the last phase of the Mughal style architecture. Check out Indira Gandhi Museum which houses some rare photographs of the late Prime Minister. Spend the evenings, strolling around the Mughal Gardens (if they are open!) or the lawns of India Gate which is always open. Day over! If you still have some spirit left, check out night life. Spend your final day in Delhi, going shopping and experiencing a bit more of Delhi. Dilli Haat is a popular shopping arcade for wares from all over India. For some street shopping, check out Janpath / Tribal Market in Connaught Place. Take your time to haggle with shopkeepers; clothes /artifacts may be overpriced. Check out exclusive shopping malls. After shopping, have lunch at one of the recommended restaurants for the cuisine of your choice. You can leave out Agra and Jaipur and have a trip to the mountains. Or checkout the adventure spots around Rishikesh. Here are some of the hill stations around Delhi that you can visit for 2-3 days. Nainital, is nestled amidst seven hills at an altitude of 1938m.

They are similar to smbldap-tools but are written in shellscript, not Perl. They only require OpenLDAP client commands (ldapadd, ldapdelete, ldapsearch, ldapmodify, ldappasswd) and make administrator's work a lot easier avoiding the need to configure Perl and each library dependency (e.g. Net::LDAP). These scripts are very simple to configure by not requiring any Samba-related information (SID, profiles, homes, etc): management of Samba attributes is entirely done by standard commands (net, smbpasswd and pdbedit) used together with the scripts. Moreover, most of the configuration is guessed from the one of nslcd, and everything should work out from the box for most users. The scripts may be used independently - within command lines - or automatically by Samba (like smbldap-tools), to handle POSIX information within accounts before adding Samba information.\n",

            "7.2.1.2 IP_ADDRESS 1689 1696 As shown in the previous section, the table expression in the SELECT command constructs an intermediate virtual table by possibly combining tables, views, eliminating rows, grouping, etc. This table is finally passed on to processing by the select list. The select list determines which columns of the intermediate table are actually output. The columns names a, b, and c are either the actual names of the columns of tables referenced in the FROM clause, or the aliases given to them as explained in Section 7.2.1.2. The name space available in the select list is the same as in the WHERE clause, unless grouping is used, in which case it is the same as in the HAVING clause. See Section 8.16.5 for more about the table_name.* notation. If an arbitrary value expression is used in the select list, it conceptually adds a new virtual column to the returned table. The value expression is evaluated once for each result row, with the row's values substituted for any column references. But the expressions in the select list do not have to reference any columns in the table expression of the FROM clause; they can be constant arithmetic expressions, for instance. If no output column name is specified using AS, the system assigns a default column name. For simple column references, this is the name of the referenced column. For function calls, this is the name of the function. For complex expressions, the system will generate a generic name. For protection against possible future keyword additions, it is recommended that you always either write AS or double-quote the output column name. The naming of output columns here is different from that done in the FROM clause (see Section 7.2.1.2). It is possible to rename the same column twice, but the name assigned in the select list is the one that will be passed on. Obviously, two rows are considered distinct if they differ in at least one column value. Null values are considered equal in this comparison. The DISTINCT ON clause is not part of the SQL standard and is sometimes considered bad style because of the potentially indeterminate nature of its results. With judicious use of GROUP BY and subqueries in FROM, this construct can be avoided, but it is often the most convenient alternative.\n",

            "192.168.0.0 IP_ADDRESS 2148 2159 DHCP leases out of WAN interface? Devices out on the 192.168.0.0/24 network, attached via Wifi to the ISP router, are given DHCP leases from the 192.168.20.0/24 server. This means that they break in various ways. Why is this happening? My understanding is that DHCP should not traverse the PfSense router at all, and there should be no way for DHCP leases to be handed out of the WAN interfaces. You definitely have something misconfigured. Out of the box, pfSense wouldn't respond to any DHCPREQUEST from WAN. You either have something cabled wrong and you're running multiple networks on the same wire, or you have done something strange in pfSense. I have a very basic config config, pretty much all I've done is add a fixed IP on the LAN port and let the WAN port receive it's IP from DHCP with a reserved address. I don't see what I could have done to break anything - any suggestions? Also in terms of the networking - again it's very basic, there's only one 'cable' and just the two networks, so I can't see what I could have misconfigured? The only way a DHCP server could be sending out leases to the WAN is if there are requests coming in. That shouldn't be happening, if you haven't opened up the firewall to allow it. What does Packet capture show? so I can't see what I could have misconfigured? Neither can we because we can't see what you've done. Post screens of your WAN and LAN interface details, your DHCP Server config and your WAN rules. You didn't happen to enable the DHCP Relay, did you? Not sure if this would be helpful but I had the same issue while I was building the firewall as my firewall was not sitting directly behind the router. As already suggested above this sounds more like a misconfiguration. It may sound silly but make sure that you have: ROUTER/WAN -> FIREWALL -> SWITCH/LAN and Not ROUTER/WAN -> SWITCH/LAN -> FIREWALL. It is obvious to me that the pfSense LAN device can \"see\" the DHCP requests from the network you think is in front of the firewall. I would packet capture on the SWITCH that is on the 192.168.20.0/24 network. If you can see the MAC addresses of the devices that are supposed to be on 192.168.0.0/24 network you have somehow crossed the streams.\n",

We had a hard time convincing our instructor of that. That is a first hand account of what it is like to go down a black diamond slope with no poles and a camera out in front. Lookout for the kid that passes me at the end, I got his autograph because you’ll likely see him in the olympics in a few years. i’m guessing you were kidding that you were on a black diamond. right? because if so, the standards at Greek are WAY low.

            ":: IP_ADDRESS 21884 21886 There are mainly two distinct parts in localization for Ryzom. The first part (and the easiest) concerns the static localization on the client side (eg interface names, error messages). The second part is for dynamically generated text from servers. As you can see in the diagram, there are four kind of file that makes the localization system to work. Each of this file must come in each localized language. In bold, you can see that each file contains the language code in its name. File formats are discussed below. Language in Ryzom are identified by there language code as defined in ISO 639-1 plus a country code defined in ISO 3166 if necessary. ISO 639-1 is a two character language code (e.g. ‘en’, ‘fr’). This is enough for most of the language we want to support. But there is some exception, like Chinese written language. Chinese can be written in two forms: traditional or simplified. Nonetheless, there is only one language code for Chinese: ‘hz’. So, we must append a country code to indicate witch form of written Chinese we discuss. The language code for simplified Chinese become ‘hz-CN’ (i.e. Chinese language, Chinese country), and for traditional Chinese, it is ‘hz’ only because all other Chinese speaking country (Taiwan, Hong Kong, ? ) use the traditional Chinese. Translated strings are associated to identifier. Identifiers are textual string that must follow the C identifier constraint with a little difference. A C identifier must consist only of the following caracteres: ‘A-Z’, ‘a-z’, ‘0-9’, ‘@‘ and ‘_’. Real C identifier can’t start with a number, string identifier can. This format is used for client side static text and for server side clause text. The file is a list of identifiant to string association (also called value string). Identifiant must conform to C identifier constraint and value string is delimited by ‘[‘ and ‘]’. Text layout is free; you can jump line and indent as you want. - Textual value can be formatted for readability. New line and tab are removed in the final string value. - If you need to specify new lines or tabulations in the value string, you must use C style escape sequence ‘\\t’ for tab and ‘\\n’ for new line. To write a ‘\\’ in the string value, double the backslash: ‘\\\\’. To write a ‘]’ int the string, escape it with a backslash: ‘\\]’. - You can split the original file in multiple small file, more easy to maintain and work with. This feature is achieved by using a C like preprocessor command “#include”. You can have any number of include command. Included files can also contains include commands. The path can be either an absolute path or a path relative to the location of the master file. This format is used for phrases translation files. As in format 1, you can include C style comment in the text and indent freely and use the include command. This format is the result of a Unicode text export from Spreadsheet. Encoding should be unicode 16 bits. Columns are tab separated and rows are new line separated. You should not write this file by hand, but only edit it with Spreadsheet. The first row must contain the columns names. If a column name start with a ‘*’, then all the column is ignored. This is useful to add information column that can help translation. It is possible to insert a ‘delete’ command in the field: ‘\\d’. This is useful for article translation. This file contains all static text available directly to the client. The text must conforms to format 1 described above. There is an additional constraint: you MUST provide as a first entry the language name, as spelled in the language (eg ‘English’ for English, ‘Français’ for French). Server side translation is a bit more complex. We will learn how to write server side translation in four steps (guess what: from simple to complex problem!). For this, you only need the phrase file. Let’s say we want a string saying “hello world!” identified by HelloWorld. Note that only the text value has changed. The phrase identifier MUST remain the same in all the translations files. In step 4, we will see that the phrase file will become very complex. Thus, this file is not well fitted for giving it to a professional translator with no skill in complex grammar file. More, the complexity of the file can hide the work to do for translation. So, you can split phrase grammar in phrase file and text value in clause file. To do this, you must assign a unique identifier to each text value. Let’s rebuild the previous example with indirection. We just have put an identifier in the phrase block. This means that the phrase refers to a string identified as “Hello” in the clause file. As in the first step, you must do this task for each language. TIPS: in order to facilitate translation work, it is possible to specify the string identifier AND the string value. This can be helpful for automatic building of translation file from the original one. In such case, the translation system always look first in the clause file and fallback to string value in the phrase file only if the string is not found in the clause file. The other advantage is that the person who wrote the phrase file can give a simplistic version of the string that a professional translator will improve. Here we are entering in the complex stuff! Each phrase can receive a list of parameter. Each parameter is given a name (or identifier) when declared. We will call it paramName. Each type of parameter CAN be associated with a ‘word’ file. This file is an excel sheet (in unicode text export form) that contain translations for the parameter: its name, undefined or defined article (e.g. ‘a’, ‘the’, etc), plural name and article and any useful property or grammar element needed for translation. The first column is very important because it associate a row of data with a particular parameter value. Let’s begin with an example: we want to build a dynamic phrase with a variable creature race name. First, we must build an excel sheet to define the words for creature type. This will be saved as race_words_<lang>.txt in unicode text export from excel. As always, you must provide a version of this file for each language. NB: The first column MUST always be the association field and you should have a ‘name’ column as it’s the default replacement for parameter. Any other column is optional and can vary from language to language to accommodate any specific grammar constraint. As stated in the note above, the first column give the race identifier as defined in the game dev sheets. The second column is the ‘highly advisable’ column for the name of the race. The ‘p’ column if the plural name. ‘ia’, ‘da’ stand for indefined article and defined article. As you can see, after the phrase identifier KILL_THIS_CREATURE we have the parameter list between the braket. We declare a parameter of type race named crea. Note that you choose freely your parameter name but each parameter must have a unique name (at least for one phrase). As you can see, it’s not too complex. $crea$ will be replaced with the content of the field from the words file in the ‘name’ column and at the row corresponding to the race identifier. ? Some parameter type have special replacement rules: int are replaced with their text representation, time are converted to ryzom time readable format, as well as money. Last but not least, the identifier and indirection rules see in step 1 and 2 are still valid. It’s time now to unveil the conditional clause system. Let’s say that the identifier and string value we put in a phrase in the previous step is a clause. And let’s say that a phrase can contains more than one clause that can be chosen by the translation engine on the fly depending on the parameter value. This is the conditional clause system. Let’s start a first example. As in step 3, we want to kill creature, but this time, we add a variable number of creature to kill, from 0 to n. What we need is conditions to select between three clause: no creature to kill, one creature to kill and more than one. We have written down three version of the text with very different meaning and gramatical structure. Now, add the conditions. Conditions are placed before the identifier and/or string value and are marked with bracket. Now, a more complex case: we want the phrase to speak differently to male or female player. This is the occasion to introduce the self parameter. Self parameter if a ‘hidden’ parameter that is always available and that represent the addressee of the phrase. Self parameter support name and gender property. You can provide a self_words_<lang>.txt file to handle special case (admin player with a translatable name for example). We have six clauses now. Three case on number of creature multiplied by two cases on the gender of the player. As you can see, conditional test can be combined with a ‘&’ character. This means that all the tests must be valid to select the clause. You can use any parameter as left operand for the test. You can also specify a parameter property (coming from words file) as operand. On the other hand, right test operand must be constant value (either textual or numerical value). Available operators are =, !=, <, <=, >, >=. A valid clause is a clause where the conditional combination are true with a given set of parameter value. Clauses are evaluated in the same order as they are written in the phrase file. The first valid clause will be selected. If the first clause doesn’t have condition, it is used as a fallback clause when none of the conditional clauses are selected. If there is no fallback clause and none of the clauses are selected, then the first clause is selected. For the same phrase, each language can provide its own set of condition and clause to accommodate its gammatical needs. Here you file find an exhaustive list of harcoded parameters properties. These properties are always available even if no words files are provided. Futhermore, the harcoded property can’t be substituted by a word file specifying a column of the same name. Only != and test available. Mainly to compare parameter with 0. NB : use the creature_words translation file ! == 0, != 0: test if the entity is Unknown or not. name : name of the creature or name of the player. gender : gender of the creature from the model or gender of the player (from the player info). In the following translation workflow, we consider that the reference language is English. There is a series of tools and bat file to help in getting translation in sync. Here is a step by step description of how to work on translation file, what tool to use and when. Only addition to existing translation file is supported by the translation tools. If you need to modify or remove existing translation string or phrase structure, this must be done ‘by hand’ with a maximum of attention to all the languages versions. In most case, it is better to create a new translation entry instead of dealing with a modification in all the translations files and it’s almost safe to leave old unused string in the files. At least, you should NEVER make modification when there are pendings diff file. *It is highly advisable to strictly respect the described workflow *in order to avoid translation problems, missing strings and other weird problems that can arise from working with many language version of a set of file. Translation work is done in cooperation between the publisher who is doing the ‘technical’ part of the task and a profesionnal translator contractor who only translate simple string into a very high quality and rich string with respect to the context. The tools that generate diff file for translation keep the comments from the reference version. This can be helpful to give additionnal information to the translator about the context of the text. Moreover, for phrase files, the diff file automaticaly include comments that describe the parameter list. All files to translate are stored in a well defined directory structure called ‘the translation repository’. All translation work is done in this repository. Tools are provided to install the translated file in the client and server repository after a translation cycle is done. languages.txt A simple text file that contains all the language code (ISO 639-2) that we are working on (eg : en, fr, etc…). work/ This is the starting point for addition of new content. This directory contains any files that can be edited for addition. diff/ Contains all diff files generated by tools. This is where most of the work is done. After the merge operation is applied to integrate translated diff into translated file, the diff file are moved to the history directory. When diff files are generated, they are prefixed with a version number automaticaly computed from the current Unix time. This permits to generate new diff file without waiting for diff translation to be done. More, when you generate new diff file with existing none merged diff, new diff only contains the new difference (is it clear or what? ? ). history/ Contains all the diff files that have been translated and merged. This is for backup and security reason. translated/ Contains all translated file. The content of this directory is installed into client and server repository when translation cycle is done. You should never change anything by hand in this directory unless you now exactly what you are doing. Creates the reference file en.uxt in the work directory, fill in the required first string ‘LanguageName’ then add any number of string for the English version. Generates static string diff files with the command make_string_diff.bat. This will create diff files for each language in the diff directory. Send the diff files to the Translator. Send them back to the Publisher. Put the translated diff files in the diff directory (this will overwrite non translated diff files with translated one). Merge the translated diff files with the command merge_string_diff.bat. This will create the <lang>.uxt files for each language in the translated directory and move the diff in the history directory. After the initial task is done, the workflow enters the in incremental mode. Add string in the reference file en.uxt in the addtion directory. Merge the translated diff files with the command merge_string_diff.bat. This will apply the diff files to the <lang>.uxt files for each language in the translated directory and move the diff in the history directory. Creates the reference file phrase_en.uxt in the addition directory and add any number of phrase entries for the English version. Generates phrase diff files with the command make_phrase_diff.bat. This will create diff files for each language in the diff directory. Translate the phrase diff file. This implie good knowledge of gramatical structure of each language to accommodate clause selection rules. Merge the translated diff with the command merge_phrase_diff.bat. This will create all the phrase_<lang>.txt in the translated directory from the translated diff then move diff files to history directory. Generates clauses diff file with the command make_clause_diff.bat. This create clause diff file in the diff directory for all language. Translate the clause diff files. Put the translated clause diff files in the diff directory (this will overwrite non translated clause diff files with translated one). Merge the translated clause diff files with the command merge_clause_diff.bat. This will create the clause_<lang>.txt files for each language in the translated directory and move the diff in the history directory. Add new phrase in phrase_en.uxt in the addition directory. Merge the translated diff with the command merge_phrase_diff.bat. This will append the diff to there repective phrase_<lang>.txt file in the translated directory then move diff files to history directory. Generates clauses diff file with the command make_clause_diff.bat. This create clause diff file in the diff directory. Merge the translated clause diff files with the comment merge_clause_diff.bat. This will append the diff file to there repective clause_<lang>.txt files for each language in the translated directory and move the diff in the history directory. NB: ‘words’ has nothing to do with the microsoft program Word! Words files are always updated by hands because they are rarely updated by the publisher (and generaly, this will be for big update). Moreover, when new phrase are translated, it can be necessary to create and fill new column in one of the words file to accommodate the translation. So, there is only a workflow but no tools. Build the initial sheet for each type of parameter with all the possible identifier in the reference language in the translated directory. Create and fill the default ‘name’ and ‘p’ columns. Create the sheets for all languages by copying the reference language sheets. Create and fill any basic column depending on languages. Sends all the sheets to the Translator. Translate all the sheets in all language, eventualy, create any needed columns. Send back the translated sheets to the Publisher. Keep a copy of the translated sheets as reference for phrase and clause translation. Put the translated sheets in the translated directory, overwriting old ones. While translating phrase or clause diff, it comes that one or more new columns are needed for some language and parameter type. Contact Publisher to check that no sheets updates are pending. If yes, first apply the ‘new sheets content’ workflow. Add and fill the new columns into the concerned sheets/langs. Send the sheets to the Publisher. Put the new sheets in the translated directory, overwriting old ones. New game content is to be integrated in the game. Contact Translator to check that no sheets updates are pending. If yes, first apply the ‘new column(s) needed’ workflow. Create new sheets for the reference language and containing only the new content. Add and fill the default columns in the new sheets (see ‘Initial task’). Create new sheets for all the languages by copying the reference languages sheets. Add but DON’T FILL all the columns to repect the current sheet format for each type, each language. Send the new sheets to the Translator. Append the new sheets at the end of the existing sheets. Send the merge result to the Pushisher. Keep the merge result as reference for phrase and clause translation and futur content addition. After a cycle of translation is terminated, you must install the translated files into the client and servers directory strucure. This is done via the command intall_translation.bat. The <lang>.uxt file are copied into the client strucure in Ryzom/gamedev/language. All the other files are copied in Ryzom/data_shard. To apply client side translation, Publisher needs to make a patch. To apply server side translation, just enter the command ‘reload’ on the InputOutputService. As a NeL/Ryzom programmer, you can use the translation system with a very few calls. To obtain a unicode string from a string identifier, you use the NLMISC::CI18N class. First of all, you must ensure that the translation file *.uxt are available in the search path. Then, you can load a language string set by calling NLMISC::CI18N::load(languageCode). The parameter languageCode is the language code as defined in chapter 2 “Language code”. After that, call the method NLMISC::CI18N::get(identifier) to obtain the unicode string associated to identifier. Dynamic string requires a bit more work and a complete shard infrastructure. Dynamic string management involves a requesting service (RQS), the InputOutputService (IOS), the FrontEnd (FE), the ryzom client plus the basic services to run the other (naming, tick, mirror). RQS is a service that wants to send a dynamic string to the client. RQS also send the dynamic string identifier to the client by using the database or any other way. The proxy is a small piece of code that builds and sends the PHRASE message to IOS service. IOS make the big task of parsing parameter, selecting the good clause and building the resulting string then sending a minimum amount of data to the client. The client receives the phrase and requests any missing string element to the IOS. To access the proxy function, you need to include game&#95;share/string&#95;manager&#95;sender.h and link with game&#95;share.lib. You first need to build the parameters list. This is done by filling a vector of STRING_MANAGER::TParam struture. For each parameter, you must set the Type field then write the appropriate member data. You MUST exactly respect the phrase parameter definition in the phrase file. destClientId is the entity id of the destination client, phraseIdentifier is the indentifier like writen in the phrase file, parameters is the vector of parameter you have build before. This function returns the dynamic ID that is assigned to this phrase. bot_name: Fill Identifier with the bot name without function. literal: Fill Literal with the Unicode literal string. On the client side, accessing the dynamic string is pretty easy. You only need to take care of transmission delay in certain case. Once you get the dynamic string id from anyway (eg database), you just need to pol the getDynString method of STRING_MANAGER::CStringManagerClient. The method return false until the requested string is incomplete or unknown. Even when the method return false, it could return a partial text with missing replacement text. Dynamic strings are dynamicaly stored, and if your code is smart enough, it could release the dynamic string memory when they are no more needed by calling releaseDynString. In order to be efficient, one can call each frame the getDynString method until it return true, then store away the string and call the releaseDynString. STRING_MANAGER::CStringManagerClient is based on the singleton pattern so you must call STRING_MANAGER::CStringManagerClient::instance() to get a pointer to the singleton instance. Here is a simple code sample. * and print the dynamic string in the log. * Call it each frame until it return true. There are many place for text in Ryzom, this page will clarify the text identification conventions, the available context for text insertion and contextual text parameters. These identifiers are written lower case with capital at start of each new word. These identifiers are written in capitals, words are separated with an underscore. These identifiers are written like strings identifiers in en.uxt. But, as they are inside a phrase definition, they must contains the name of the phrases as base name. The phrases name is lowered to respect the string identifiers convention. Furthermore, when there is more than one clause for a given phrase, the clause identifier must be followed by some tags that give clues to the translator about the meaning of each clause. Chat context cover any texts that come from an NPC through the chat windows and text bubbles. There is only one parameter available: the npc entity that say/shout. Two parameters: the bot that talk and the player. Two parameters: the bot clicked and the player. Botchat cover any texts that come in the interactive NPC dialog. All phrase name related to mission have of root defined by the name of the mission as placed in the world editor mission node. _END for the mission end text. Les paramètres des textes d'étapes du journal dépendent de la nature de l'étape (voir avec Nicolas Brigand). Le premier est le texte standard, le second est affiché quand on doit donner quelque chose au bot. It is possible to add simple ‘informational’ entry in the bot contextual menu.

I forgot to mention the server with the data is running windows 7. The other clients are running a mix of windows 7 and 8.1. I have the port range 54000-55000 forwarded and working perfectly for 2 years using this server for simple file transfers. The error comes from problems with connections between different networks, I don't know why it happens if you are using your local network. Make sure that the firewall is not the problema with the client computer. Disabling firewall doesn't seem to change anything. Tried on both ends. Maybe someone has another solution ? How about an alternative? Forget VLC? Other streaming solutions that would work over network? Doing over FTP is more trouble than it has to be. Just install Plex Media Server on the computer with the media on it and stream to other computer or devices with the Plex app or with a web browser. hmm, it downscales and reencodes my videos - that wasn't the idea. I need it to play the actual file as it is, if possible. Pretty interresting thing this Plex though. I will probably play about with it a bit more. It will be played on a computer every time, not a TV where the signal needs to be a specific format. Stream it using VLC from the server to VLC on your local network. Or install Apache and put it in a directory accessible using Apache. VLC will play videos over HTTP perfectly fine.\n",

            "255.255.255.255 IP_ADDRESS 653 668 Normally I use a cable modem plugged into my ethernet port, and it was trivial to set up. Now I´m trying to hook up the same laptop at a friend´s house where there´s only a cable modem with USB connection. It´s a Motorola SBV5120E surfboard modem, so I followed the instructions above. /var/log/messages already mentioned \"using uhci_hcd and address 5\" so it sounded good. When I ran \"ifconfig -a\" it listed three eth connections, eth1, eth2 and eth3 - presumably one is my normal ethernet in, one is my wireless and the third is the USB modem? I wasn´t sure which was which so ran dhclient on all three, but each one just said \"DHCPDISCOVER on eth* to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval *\" a few times and then \"No DHCPOFFERS received. No working leases in persistent database - sleeping.\" My first attempt at setting it up was using the \"Setup a new network interface\" wizard, but none of the given options (Ethernet, DVB, Cable modem, DSL, ISDN, Wireless, GPRS, Bluetooth, POTS) led to anything which would let me select the USB device. Any other tips, or should I just give up? It should be possible, right? Is there anything special you have to do with a USB modem, or is it better to stick to ethernet connections? Should it work and I am just choosing the wrong buttons, or is it unlikely to work at all this way? Fortunately this particular modem also has an ethernet socket, and I managed to get hold of an ethernet cable to try it out - with this the network works ok, but the modem seems to need a power cycle to realise whether it should be using the USB output or the ethernet output.\n",

            ":: IP_ADDRESS 1624 1626 The reputation of the KDE ecosystem was tarnished by a crappy release process for KDE4. Essential desktop components simply weren't ready for release in 4.0 and 4.1 (some of them still are mostly vaporware) after a huge barrage of hype had massively raised expectations, and this generated a lot of (well deserved) bad publicity. The answer? Go and rebrand it, so that the development process can be broken up more easily and people will be persuaded to blame the right developers for each component. And while we are at it, let's throw out KDE's well-earned reputation for deep integration, the idea of the DE as a complete platform for users and developers. Let's give users the idea that KDE is just a \"compilation\" of bits and bobs thrown together for no particular reason, on the way overlapping as much as possible with the concept of \"distribution\", making it fun for companies to explain the difference and for developers to understand what they can and cannot rely on for their apps. Now KDE is supposed to be just a \"community\", a \"club\" of like-minded (C++) people hanging out in Gran Canaria and the like. Yeah, that will be fun. Honestly, I've been a big KDE fan for ages, but the development process for KDE4 was clearly wrong on so many levels. Developers' reactions to user feedback in the last two years have been astonishingly patronizing, and this is just another instance of it. Just admit that errors were made and get to work, please, instead of wasting time jet-setting from one \"conference\" to another (preferably in remote islands with good nightclubs), talking about marketing b*llocks. The Akonadi::ItemView class, which should provide a default, out-of-the-box view of data stored by Akonadi (KDE 4 technology), depending on the type of resource it represents, cannot be included in a Plasma.Applet (KDE 4 technology) but only in a KXmlGuiClient or KXmlGuiWindow (KDE 3 technology). Clearly dogfood isn't as tasty as apple pie. Questa mattina il Corriere della Sera ha fatto risparmiare qualche litro di caffe' ai poveri genitori di bambini italiani all'estero. Il pezzo \"Anche i bimbi avranno il loro passaporto\", infatti, conteneva abbastanza allarmismo da provocare diversi casi di tachicardia acuta in adulti con prole, quasi tutti in fase di preparazione per l'inevitabile rientro natalizio sul Suolo Patrio. \"Dal 25 novembre, tutti i bambini in viaggio all'estero avranno in mano il loro documento con nome e foto, così come prevede la nuova disciplina comunitaria.\" Panico. Fino a ieri per i minori bastava essere presenti sul passaporto dei genitori. Per avere un nuovo passaporto ci vuole piu' di un mese! Natale e' il 25 dicembre e il nostro aereo e' fra X giorni! Possibile che il Ministero degli Esteri si sia creato dal nulla una montagna di lavoro proprio sotto Natale? \"I passaporti contenenti l'iscrizione di minori rilasciati fino ad oggi rimangono comunque validi fino alla scadenza e tutte le richieste di iscrizione del figlio minore sul proprio passaporto pervenute fino a ieri saranno evase fino al 15 dicembre.\" Ergo, l'affermazione che \"dal 25 novembre, tutti i bambini in viaggio [...] avranno in mano il loro documento\" e' palesemente falsa. E il preoccupato genitore puo' finalmente rilassarsi con una bella tazza di caffe' fumante, magari (per oggi) decaffeinato. VmWare Server 2.0 ships with a web-based user-interface that is, to put it bluntly, an abomination. Supposedly, it is that way in order to simplify requirements: gone is the command-line API-based interface of 1.0 (which is now only available in the pricier products, what a coincidence), now the only thing you need is a web browser and a plugin that will display the consoles of virtualized instances. This is all well and good when the plugin works. Which is, considering the constant flow of browser updates, not quite often. In particular, it seems that after upgrading to Firefox 3.5, the plugin stopped recognizing my arrow keys (of all things). I tried running it as a standalone client, which is surprisingly simple (just locate vmware-vmrc in your Firefox profile folder and use it to connect to the main server on port 8333), with no success. I've even followed some blog advice to add something to /etc/vmware/config, but that didn't do it for me. Reboot the instance and voilà, you will be able to connect with a better client, like xTightVnc, where arrow keys do work properly. You can obviously change the port and password to suit your needs. Considering the sort of negative person I am (I'm sure scientologists would classify me as \"suppressive personality\" in zero time), it doesn't come as a surprise that one of the most popular items on this blog is a rant about Amarok 2. Having recently upgraded my Linux laptop, however, I found that Amarok was also upgraded to release 2.2.1, and I decided to give it a go. The experience was, overall, a positive one, so I thought I owed to the developers a follow-up to my previous rap. Amarok 2.2.1 finally addresses 99% of the problems and regressions that plagued 2.0. The terrible default layout is now highly customizable (click on View -> Lock Layout to unlock the widgets, then drag&drop them where you want), so you can recreate the much-saner 1.x disposition. You can also customize the top toolbar (which by default is wasting so much screen real-estate, you could probably display three different applications in the same amount of space) to be more compact, by selecting View -> Slim Toolbar. Support for radio and podcasting is now first-rate (I don't know about external disks/mediaplayers), and plugins for various Internet services are quite good. MySQL is back to being an optional back-end for the internal music catalog. In short, if you still are on 1.x and can upgrade to KDE4/Qt4, you should probably give it a go. So, 18 months down the line, Amarok is basically back to where it was in release 1.4, plus some eyecandy and (we are told) a better, more modular infrastructure. In order to achieve this, developers endured a year of bad publicity and hate-mail from their own users, lost market share, and basically looked hapless at prioritizing features and designing interfaces. Was it worth it? To me, it still looks like another proof that benefits of \"big rewrites\" are dubious at best, like Joel Spolsky said so many years ago. I suspect we will eventually come to say the same about the whole KDE4 process, but I guess the jury is still out on that one. Children are to parents what Big Rewrites are to programmers: the occasion to start from scratch after taking into account all the hacks and bad decisions from previous versions, resulting in a superior implementation of a well-known solution. Or so parents (and programmers) like to think. Except that children and programs tend to have a life of their own, and the most successful strategy is often to just get along doing whatever the little monsters are successful at, which may or may not be what the previous release intended to do. tell them they are \"high cost\" compared to Egyptian, Indian or Rumanian counterparts. tell them that, despite the company being afloat in cash, there's no money for pay increases for the N-th year running. tell them that the money is \"reserved to the mergers&acquisitions strategy\". We don't reward our workforce, we reward our competitors; as soon as you can, please go and become one. tell them that \"promotions with no pay increase\" are perfectly normal. Same for workload increases. Imply that you should count yourself lucky to still have a job. The beatings will continue until morale improves. tell them that, if you don't like it, they have a choice (i.e. walking). But at the same time, \"we have to get better at sharing knowledge\". Sure, I'll get to that right away (not). give them new internal systems that don't work. When workers complain, dismiss them as whiners. Make sure there is no plan-B after The Big Go-Live. Once TBGL results in complete customer-affecting disaster, panic. Time to work on personal projects. Big time. Dear SUN employees in Europe, you really really should cheer for the EU. May you be spared a terrible fate. Anyway, here's a bit background: basically, ATI stopped releasing proprietary Linux drivers for their old cards. So you can either use the old drivers, or move to the open-source ones (a complete rewrite, which only recently got good enough for real use). But here's the problem: the version of (KDE window manager) KWin shipped with Karmic crashes horribly with the old ATI drivers, and recent Xorg releases don't really work well with them anyway. So you haven't much of a choice: move to the free drivers and thank Stallman for inventing the cure to the annoying problem of manufacturers dropping support for products after less than five years. Note AccelMethod being set to XAA. In the future that will probably be EXA (which apparently is a newer algorithm), but my experiments with it included too many crashes for my taste. \"AGPSize\" \"128\" -- from what I understand, this should just be the amount of video RAM you have. I put this here so I may remember to search my blog next time instead of wasting time going through random forum threads, but I hope it may be of help to fellow Radeon linuxers. All in all, KDE 4.3 is lovely, but it kinda reminded me that five years is quite a long lifespan for a laptop. Configuration utilities have been somewhat cleaned up, in a long-overdue effort. +1, but for the love of God stop with the Gnome-like zealotry. Total: +1. So I guess it was all worth.\n",

            ":: IP_ADDRESS 13 17 My Daily Dose :: \"Believe\" Have you ever told someone about a goal you may have had only to have him or her laugh, ridicule, or even mock you for your belief in being able to accomplish it? It can be disheartening and downright hurtful. Mocking or poking fun at someone may be done in a lighthearted way, but it can be done in a way that is very hurtful as well. Such was the case of a bunch of people at the house of Jairus, a ruler in the Jewish synagogue. Now Jesus took a select group of people consisting of Jairus, Peter, James, and John to Jairus’ home, where they met a group of people who were weeping and wailing loudly. Jesus looked at them and then asked them, “Why make this commotion and weep? The child is not dead, but sleeping.”(Mk. 5:39). The people chose not to believe Jesus, and instead they ridiculed Him, or as the Greek word katagelao, kat-ag-el-ah´-o implies, they laughed at Him and put Him down. In short they mocked Him in disbelief. Jesus responded by having them put out of the home, and He then proceeded to take those who believed with Him up to her room where she was lying. We can see result of their faith coupled with God’s will for this situation in the following verses. God had clearly done a work, but He chose to do it in His abundant power through those who believed. He didn’t allow those people who were faithless to be a part of this miracle, but instead He moved them away, so only those with true faith remained. I think we can learn something here if we are to experience the power of God working within our own lives. Perhaps we need to align ourselves with those who want to come in agreement with God’s perfect will, and who strongly believe in God’s amazing power being manifested in prayer. Maybe we need to move out the mockers in our life—those who would cast doubt about our walk, our prayers, and who mock what God wants to do within our lives. I want to encourage you today to continue to walk in faith. Always trust God and believe in His will being accomplished in every situation. Don’t stop believing because you don’t see “your” will being done, but ask for, and trust in, His perfect will and timing. Then simply believe! Remember, the fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much (Jas. 5:16). STUDY QUESTION: According to 1 John 5:14-15 what sort of confidence can we find in our prayers to God? PERSONAL INVENTORY: Can you identify with anyone who may be continuously mocking you in your attempt to walk in truth and newness of life? PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Identify who you are in Christ Jesus and move out the mockers in your life. Choose to believe in God’s transforming power in your life.\n",

            "123.20.35.60 IP_ADDRESS 2130 2142 Back in 1881, when 19 year old Achille Ditesheim founded Movado, I wonder if he had the vision of what this company would become. From his small village in Switzerland, is it possible he had could imagine the 100 patents and the 200 International awards that would be part of the Movado legacy…or was he, simply following his passion? Design, innovation, and quality are keywords when thinking of Movado. Creating many of the most sought-after timepieces has made Movado famous. The company didn’t stop with their dedication to beautiful design, there was enormous attention paid to functionality and comfort. In 1912 Movado patented a revolutionary movement, designed to fit into a case that was curved to the line of the wrist. These, seemingly small adjustments made huge differences in the look and feel of a Movado watch. The most well-recognized watch in the line is the Museum. It is presented with a clean, blank face, only embellished with a single dot at the 12 o’clock mark. This watch has become an iconic symbol of modern design and was the first watch to ever be chosen as part of a permanent display at the Museum of Modern Art, in New York. Movado’s delicate designs distinguish them from other watchmakers and that style, naturally transitioned the company into jewelry making. With boutiques around the world, Movado offers exquisite jewelry made from 18 ct. gold, gemstones, and their patented 114 facet Movado Diamond. Movado, literally translates into, “always in motion”, and that standard is what sets Movado apart. I for one, believe that young entrepreneur would be proud and excited to see that his vision has been expanded beyond his own imagination. Movado is style, design, and innovation at its best. Omega Watch Sales are a great find for anyone looking for a fine watch at the best price. On-line searches of Omega watches can produce substantial savings for a savvy shopper.

This identifier presents it of this kind: 79.91.205.119. It is thanks to this series of figures that one can know where the people connecting to such and such websites come from. If you use download sites this is also the IP address that will locate you. Why hide its ip address? (6) Avoid your IP address being stolen and used to launch spam campaigns. (7) Avoid being pinged at all times. (8) Limit pop-ups and inadvertent ads. (9) Limit the risk of an IP spoofing (IP spoofing, used especially by hackers to hide their identities during computer attacks). (10) Finally, more pragmatically, this will allow you to override certain limits set by your employer, sites (geographical limits like on Bebo, Orkut ...), your ISPs ... like the limit of viewing on certain streaming sites, or override The limits of loading in guest on sites such as megaupload. For all that, you just need to use a vpn which will allow you to hide IP quickly and encrypt your connection. As I know, Flyvpn provides free VPN for many countries, but it log out every 20 minutes. If you want to keep online always, you can choose paying vpn to get over 300 ip addresses, 17 countries covered.

            ":: IP_ADDRESS 2805 2807 APEX uses the best of the modern web to create native web applications; unfortunately, this also brings modern vulnerabilities that we always need to be aware of. To protect applications, APEX has a number of in-built security features available to prevent SQL Injection and Cross Site Scripting. Often, important processes in our applications fire when a button is clicked. For UI reasons, if a process can’t be fired, or the users don’t have permission to do it, the button may become inactive or disabled. However, this is only HTML, if the application process is not safe, someone with a minor knowledge of HTML can revert this button back to life and boom! Fire you process! Let’s first see what is behind a disabled button; if we inspect this button using the chrome console (right click on the button and select “inspect”), something similar to the code below will show. <button onclick=\"apex.confirm('Are you sure you want to place this order?','PLACE_ORDER');\" If we remove the property disabled=”” and the class apex_disabled, the button becomes active and clickable again. So, should I hide the button? Therefore, what if I hide the button and add a Server-side Condition in the application process to only fire when the SAVE button is clicked? We need also insure that each page has access protection, otherwise the hacker can set inject values in the URL. The page may be requested using a URL, with or without session state arguments, and without having to have a checksum. The URL below includes the RIR request and set the value 1 for the P4_ITEM. If Request, Clear Cache, or Name/Value Pair arguments appear in the URL, a checksum must also be provided. The URL below includes the RIR request, set the value 1 for the P4_ITEM and include a checksum. If we manually try to change the value, 1 to another one, the user will get the following error. Session state protection violation: This may be caused by manual alteration of a URL containing a checksum or by using a link with an incorrect or missing checksum. If you are unsure what caused this error, please contact the application administrator for assistance. A URL may be used to request the page, but the URL cannot contain Request, Clear Cache, or Name/Value Pair arguments. The page may not be accessed using a URL. However, the page may be the target of a Branch to Page branch type, as this does not perform a URL redirect. Avoid by applying conditions to the application process that check page items. Create page validations to double check using the same rule that made the button disabled. Use APEX authorization schemes to validate page access. Even if a page is not available on the menu to a specific user, the user can set the page number in the page URL (https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=107300:4:6447557498631::NO:::) and go to the page if there is no authorization is selected. To create authorization schemes, go to Shared Components \\ Authorization Schemes and then any that you create will be available in the page properties. APEX is very safe and used by numerous military and classified agencies around the world, but like most web technologies, the developers needs to know and use the security resources in order to avoid breaches that could make the app vulnerable. Rodrigo is a Development Consultant at Explorer. Rodrigo has an Oracle APEX Developer Expert Certification issued by Oracle and is an experienced software engineer with emphasis in analysis, design and development of bespoke Oracle applications utilising development tools such as PL/SQL, APEX and Forms for a variety of international businesses.\n",

With the invent of PSPs, XBOXs, and other high-tech video gaming platforms, it seems rather pertinent to take a step back and think. We all are very aware of the climate changes and the importance of going green in whatever tiniest way possible. A lot of us do try to bring changes to our daily lifestyle to protect the environment. We must, there’s no way around it. A small step in this direction could lead us to use Green Toys. Green toys or eco-friendly toys are made of paper, bamboo, wood, recycled cardboard etc. These eco-friendly toys are fun and educational too. The other day I stumbled upon a website promoting some of these products and I found them rather interesting. Would love to hear from toy makers and parents who are leading in green toy movement.\n",

This customfield appears in Create screen and in transition1 screen. This customfield has a Datasource SIL script associated. I need to launch a different sql in \"create\" transition and than in \"transition1\" transition. The problem is that argv[\"screen\"] returns \"\" in both cases and I don't know how specify in the datasource sil script this case. But argv[\"screen\"] returns always null. Anyone knows how can I do this? As long as you have JJUPIN installed & enabled, argv[\"screen\"] should always return the right values (view/create/edit/trans_x). Have you tried to set the log level on DEBUG and check why is the value of the screen coming wrong? I've added the results in log. Do you find any clue? I've seen your comment. My bad, I forgot that you're not using this via Live Fieds, but via KCF Pro. That's why it doesn't work: KCF Pro only knows how to get the values for the dependent fields. Unfortunately, I think that at the moment there's no way to get the screen value on a datasource. Ok Alexandra, then I'll use a customfield to charge on it an specific value depending on the transition and then I'll define it as dependen field for the KCF. It's a trick but I think it'll work.

            "93.184.216.34 IP_ADDRESS 932 945 Just over two years ago, we wrote about a massive DDoS attack against Spamhaus. And a DDoS is a Distributed Denial of Service attack, where you abuse lots of computers at the same time to flood someone’s server with purposeless traffic so it can’t keep up. …before hanging up without buying anything. The enquiries seem legitimate at first, but generate no business while at the same time keeping genuine callers at the back of a long queue. Apparently, the attacks against Spamhaus were stirred up in a controversy called Stophaus, in which a countercultural posse of internet users discussed taking out Spamhaus. The Stophaus schemers, it seems, wanted to teach Spamhaus some kind of lesson for daring to take a stance against spam. The trick they used is called DNS amplification, and it works like this. DNS is the system that converts (amongst other things) internet names such as www.example.com into internet numbers such as 93.184.216.34. Ones that run on your router at home to service your home network, which simply relay your queries unaltered onwards to your ISP, or some other public server like Google’s well-known 8.8.8.8. Ones that organisations run as their own official DNS servers to give so-called authoritative answers to queries for the domains they own. Ones that will accept your queries, reply immediately if they have the answer cached already, or else recursively (a fancy word for “in their turn”) ask the authoritative servers on your behalf, cache the result for everyone else, and reply to you. Most recursive servers aren’t public, unlike Google’s 8.8.8.8, because they end up doing a lot of work and carrying a lot of traffic. So recursive servers are usually restricted to customers of a specific ISP, or to computers inside your company, or some other handily circumscribed set of users. Or, if they’re open to the public, they are carefully managed to prevent abuse. One sort of abuse is to make multiple small requests to a recursive server such that each request provokes a much bigger request-and-reply from the authoritative server belonging to your victim. Small requests turning into large ones is where the name amplification comes in. In theory, amplification attacks should be hard to do, because the majority of DNS servers aren’t supposed to be recursive – in other words, they shouldn’t pass on requests willy-nilly to other people’s servers at all. The problem was, at least when the Stophaus attack was carried out, that lots and lots of home routers – perhaps 20 million or more – were misconfigured to act as full-blown recursive servers for the whole world, as well as plain-old relay servers for the owner’s home network. So the Spamhaus attackers had millions of misconfigured DNS servers at their disposal that they could use to turn millions of modest and innocent-looking outbound DNS requests from their attack zombies into much larger amounts of DNS request-and-reply traffic, all of it aimed at Spamhaus. According to reports, Spamhaus’s DNS servers were subjected to traffic peaks of 300Gbit/sec, the sort of attack that quickly gets not only disruptive but expensive. Within a month or so, a 16-year-old was arrested for allegedly taking part in the Stophaus attack scene. He couldn’t be named, being under 18, but he did put his hand up and plead guilty the following year to a bunch of offences. At the time, those offences were reported as including money laundering and child abuse, with sentencing deferred until 2015. The guilty party, having now turned 18, has recently been sentenced in Southwark crown court, and named as Seth Nolan Mcdonagh. It sounds as though he wasn’t just a piracy-loving activist-leaning youngster who fell in with older hacker/cracker types and went along for the ride. The BBC’s report suggests that Mcdonagh, who went by “narko” online, would take money to attack named websites, making him a sort of DDos gun-for-hire. In fact, “narko” apparently had £72,000 (then about $105,000) in the bank at the time of the attacks – not a bad nest-egg for a 16-year-old – plus 1000 stolen credit card numbers on his computer. Nevertheless, the court has given him a chance to reform without going to prison: he’s been sentenced to 240 hours of community service. Let’s hope Mcdonagh, now legally an adult, takes this as an opportunity, not a lucky escape. DDoS imagery courtesy of Shutterstock. people who’s credit cards were stolen and to Spamhaus for damages. I’m not sure what happened to the money…if it could be shown to be the proceeds of crime, I assume (not sure – anyone from the UK care to comment?) that it would have ended up forfeited to the Crown. lad [noun, informal]: boy or young man. I don’t know enough about the specifics of the case or about the offender to comment on the sentence, however I will say that the difference between the US sentences, which are crazily over the top, compared with this sentence don’t make any sense. 240 hours of community service?? He had £72,000 in his bank account for deeds already performed and stolen credit card numbers. I too don’t have enough knowledge of the case to form an educated opinion. Perhaps those community service hours can be put to good use by partnering with law enforcement to stop the criminal activity or restoring the loses of those attacked. Odd no mention here of him Swatting people, trying to get them killed by unwitting police. The lad will suffer and no country or law will help him as he begs for mercy. At 16 years old that kid has a lot left to learn. Cut him loose, train him, and make him work for Spamhaus deterring future attacks. He will appreciate more than anything and hopefully learn his lesson.\n",

            "192.168.1.1 IP_ADDRESS 806 817 This tutorial has its origin on a thread at Digit forum where a member asked if we can restore lost password from router. I decided to put my CCNA skills to use. And indeed after some adventures with ATMOS commands, I figured it out. So here it goes. You will need your router password to reset your ISP password. This is different from your ISP acount’s password. On most routers, the default username / password combination is admin/admin or admin/1234 . If you have changed your router password and forgot it too, then I cant help you. You can though reset router password with Reset slot in your router. Run HyperTerminal by Start > Programs > Accesories> Communications > HyperTerminal. Enter any name for the Connection. Click on OK. In the Connect Using combo box, select TCP/IP (WinSock) and enter 192.168.1.1 as Host address. (192.168.1.1 is usually your router’s address ). If you have customized your router’s ip address then enter the customized address. The Port Number 23 is fine, no need to change it. Click on Connect. You will get a login prompt. Enter your router username and password here. If all goes allright you will get a prompt saying “Login Successful”. The prompt will change to Quantum fm>. Now in HyperTerminal, click on Transfer > Capture Text. Enter a location to save the settings file. For example My Documents\\mysettings.txt . Click on Start. You will be back to the router prompt. This is quite a big file and it will take a while to list. Just wait until the listing is complete and you get back to the prompt. Click on Transfer > Capture Text > Stop. Now the tough part is over. Now you can quit HyperTerminal . Now open the file we saved in Notepad and press Ctrl F. Enter weLogin in the string to find. I have tested this on Huawei MT880 and MT 882 routers. I cannot guarantee that they work on other routers too. But Atmos commands are usually same on all devices so they should work on other routers too.. And finally, you shouldn’t try it if you aren’t comfortable with command line usage. Don’t hold me accountable if you screwup doing things you shouldn’t be doing. Hope this helped… ! Yahoo Emoticons for MSN Messenger.. This is a long overdue post 😛 .. I was busy with CCNA and some other things so I could post it earlier.. Anyways, Here it is. Being a Yahoo Messenger user for years, I am used to Yahoo Messenger emoticons. And after some of my friends decided to shift to MSN messenger, I had to become a regular on MSN Messenger too .. But I missed Yahoo’s emoticons. And add to it that MSN Messenger’s emoticon looks ugly to me. So I decided to utilize MSN Messenger’s Custom Emoticon feature to add Yahoo emoticons to MSN Messenger. Download and extract the archive. You will get a folder called CustomEmoticons with around 80 .dat files. Right Click on the folder and select Copy. Now in your Windows drive ( C: on most systems), navigate to Application Data folder. For ex: C:\\Document & Settings \\ YourUsernameOnTheComputer \\Application Data\\ Microsoft\\ MSN Messenger\\ ARandomNumberString\\. There may be more than one folders in your MSN Messenger directory if you have multiple MSN IDs on the same computer. You have to open the folder which corresponds to the ID that you wanna have Yahoo Emoticons. Paste the CustomEmoticons folder here that you downloaded. Run MSN Messenger .. 😛 .. You have YMSN Emoticons as your custom emoticons. Do NOT use this method if you already have many custom emoticons as this may overwrite your existing Custom emoticons. Download and extract the archive. Note that this one is different from the archive above. Download and install MSN Backup. Its a great program to backup your MSN Messenger settings. We’ll use it to import custom emoticons. Run the program and enter your MSN Id in the textbox given. You will need to be running MSN Messenger too. In the right hand pane, navigate to the folder where you extracted the downloaded archive. It will take a while to load all the custom emoticons. After they have loaded, Enable the checkbox next to Emoticons in the right side pane. Click on the Install Objects button. The custom emoticons will be imported within in a minute. Most emoticans use the same format as Yahoo Messenger but for some emoticons you will need to put an extra : to make them work. For example use ::| for 😐 .\n",
